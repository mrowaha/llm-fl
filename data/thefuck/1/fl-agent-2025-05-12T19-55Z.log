agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The failing test is `test_get_new_command` in `tests/rules/test_pip_unknown_command.py`. The test is failing because the function `get_new_command` in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` is raising an `IndexError` when trying to extract a broken command from the output.

### Steps to Trace the Execution:
1. **Failing Test**: The test expects `get_new_command` to return `'pip uninstall thefuck'` when given a script `'pip un+install thefuck'` and an output `'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'`.
2. **Function Under Test**: The function `get_new_command` is supposed to extract the broken command (`'un+install'`) from the output and replace it with the suggested command (`'uninstall'`).

### Analysis:
- The error occurs because `re.findall` in `get_new_command` is not matching the pattern in the output string, resulting in an empty list. When the code tries to access the first element (`[0]`), it raises an `IndexError`.
- The regular expression pattern in `get_new_command` is `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'`, which expects the broken command to be lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`). However, the output contains `"un+install"`, which includes a `+` character, causing the pattern to fail.

### Fault Localization:
The fault lies in the regular expression pattern in `get_new_command` in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The pattern does not account for non-alphabetic characters (like `+`) in the command.

### Output:
```output
name: get_new_command
file: thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py
explanation: The regular expression pattern in `get_new_command` does not account for non-alphabetic characters (like `+`) in the command, causing the pattern to fail and raising an `IndexError`.
