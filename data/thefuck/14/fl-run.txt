 failing test is `test_not_match` in `tests/rules/test_no_command.py`. The error indicates that the test is trying to mock the `which` attribute in the module `thefuck.rules.no_command`, but the module does not have this attribute. This suggests that the test expects the `no_command` module to have a `which` function or attribute, but it does not.

### Steps to Trace the Fault:
1. **Identify the Test File**: The test file is `tests/rules/test_no_command.py`.
2. **Understand the Test**: The test is mocking `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but the module does not have this attribute.
3. **Check the Module**: The module in question is `thefuck/rules/no_command.py`.

### Next Steps:
- I will first check the import statements in `tests/rules/test_no_command.py` to understand the dependencies.
- Then, I will inspect the `no_command.py` module to see if it defines or imports `which`.

Let's start by checking the import statements in the test file.tool_get_file_imports:
 import pytest
from thefuck.rules.no_command import match, get_new_command        
from tests.utils import Command

-- Tool called: get_file_import_statements, args: {"file_path":"tests/rules/test_no_command.py"}
-- Tool output:
    <import_statements file_path="tests/rules/test_no_command.py"> 
    import pytest
from thefuck.rules.no_command import match, get_new_command        
from tests.utils import Command
    </import_statements>

 test file imports `match` and `get_new_command` from `thefuck.rules.no_command`. It does not import or reference a `which` function or attribute. However, the test is trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, which suggests that the test expects this attribute to exist in the `no_command` module.

### Next Step:
- Inspect the `no_command.py` module to see if it defines or imports `which`.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `no_command.py` module does not define or import a `which` function or attribute. This confirms the error in the test, which expects `thefuck.rules.no_command.which` to exist but it does not.

### Analysis:
- The test is trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but the module does not have this attribute.
- The test might be incorrectly assuming that `which` is part of the `no_command` module, or it might be intended to mock a dependency used by the module (e.g., `thefuck.utils.which` or another utility).

### Next Step:
- Check if `which` is imported or defined in any of the utility modules (e.g., `thefuck/utils.py`), as the `no_command` module imports from `thefuck.utils`.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `which` function is defined in `thefuck/utils.py`, not in `thefuck/rules/no_command.py`. The test is incorrectly trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which` instead of `thefuck.utils.which`.

### Fault Localization:
- The fault lies in the test file (`tests/rules/test_no_command.py`), where the mock target is incorrectly specified as `thefuck.rules.no_command.which` instead of `thefuck.utils.which`.

### Output:
name: test_not_match (incorrect mock target)
file: tests/rules/test_no_command.py
explanation: The test is trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but the `which` function is defined in `thefuck.utils.py`. The mock target should be corrected to `thefuck.utils.which`.
