Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
Let me analyze the failing test and the execution flow to localize the fault.

### Step 1: Understand the Failing Test
The failing test is `test_get_new_command` inOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 `tests/rules/test_pip_unknown_command.py`. The test is checking the behavior of the `get_new_command` function when given a pip command with a typo (`pip un+install thefuck`). The expected output is `pip uninstall thefuck`.

The error occurs in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` at line 15, where an `IndexError` is raised because `re.findall` returns an empty list. This suggests that the regular expression pattern used to extract the broken command from the error message is not matching the input.

### Step 2: Analyze the `get_new_command` Function
The `get_new_command` function is defined in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The function attempts to extract the broken command from the error message using a regex pattern:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

The error message provided in the test is:
```
ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"
```

The regex pattern `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is designed to match lowercase alphabetic characters (`[a-z]+`). However, the broken command in the error message is `un+install`, which includes a `+` character. This is why the regex fails to match, and `re.findall` returns an empty list, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Step 3: Identify the Fault
The fault lies in the regex pattern in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The pattern does not account for non-alphabetic characters (like `+`) in the broken command. Since the actual error message includes `un+install`, the pattern needs to be updated to handle such cases.

### Step 4: Verify the Regex Pattern
Let me confirm the regex pattern and its behavior by checking the actual file content of `pip_unknown_command.py`.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

-- Tool called: get_file_content, args: {"file_path":"thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py","definitions":["get_new_command"]}
-- Tool output: <file_content file_path="thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py">
import re
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument, for_app
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                            command.output)[0]

</file_content>
OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` uses the regex pattern `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` to extract the broken command from the error message. As identified earlier, this pattern fails to match commands that include non-alphabetic characters like `+`.

### Step 5: Propose a Fix
The regex pattern should be updated to include non-alphabetic characters (like `+`) in the broken command. For example, the pattern could be modified to:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

This updated pattern will match:
- Alphabetic characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`).
- The `+` character.

### Step 6: Validate the Fix
To ensure the fix works, the test case `test_get_new_command` should pass with the updated regex pattern. The test input `pip un+install thefuck` will now correctly match the broken command `un+install` from the error message.

### Conclusion
The fault is in the regex pattern in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The pattern needs to be updated to handle non-alphabetic characters in the broken command. The fix involves modifying the regex to include `+` and other possible non-alphabetic characters that might appear in pip commands.
