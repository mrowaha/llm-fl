### Step 6: Analyze the `patterns` List
The `patterns` list contains strings that indicate permission-related errors. The first entry is `'permission denied'`, which matches the `stderr` value (`'Permission denied'`) in the failing test. This explains why the `match` function returns `True`.

### Step 7: Identify the Fault
The test expects `match` to return `False` for `'sudo ls'` with `'Permission denied'`, but the `patterns` list includes `'permission denied'`, causing the function to return `True`. This suggests that the `patterns` list is too permissive or not correctly tailored to the intended behavior.

### Step 8: Conclusion
The fault lies in the `patterns` list in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py`. It includes `'permission denied'`, which is causing the `match` function to return `True` for cases where it should return `False`.

---

name: `patterns`  
file: `thefuck/rules/sudo.py`  
explanation: The `patterns` list includes `'permission denied'`, which causes the `match` function to incorrectly return `True` for commands where `stderr` contains `'Permission denied'`. This contradicts the test's expectation that such cases should return `False`. The list should be refined to exclude overly broad patterns.
