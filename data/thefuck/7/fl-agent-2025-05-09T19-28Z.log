agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `match` function is very simple:
```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

### Step 4: Analyze the `match` Function Logic
The function checks if the string `"php -s"` is present in the `command.script`. In the failing test, the `command.script` is:
```python
'php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080'
```
The function is looking for `"php -s"`, but the script contains `"php -t pub -s"`. The substring `"php -s"` is not present in the script because of the `-t pub` part in between.

### Step 5: Identify the Fault
The fault lies in the `match` function's logic. It is too strict in checking for the exact substring `"php -s"`. The test case suggests that the function should also match scripts where `-s` is present, even if other flags like `-t` are included.

### Step 6: Propose a Fix
The `match` function should be updated to check for the presence of `-s` in the script, regardless of other flags. For example:
```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "-s" in command.script
```

### Step 7: Verify the Fix
I will verify if this change would make the test pass by checking if `"-s"` is present in the test script:
```python
'php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080'
```
Yes, `"-s"` is present, so the updated `match` function would return `True`.

### Conclusion
The fault is in the `match` function in `thefuck/rules/php_s.py`. The function's logic is too restrictive and should be updated to check for the presence of `-s` instead of `php -s`.
