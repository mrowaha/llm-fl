Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll check which definitions from the list are present in the file:
   - 'regex' is defined in the file (line 7: `regex = re.compile(r'No such command: (.*)\.')`)

2. Since 'regex' is defined in the file itself (not imported), I should keep it according to the restrictions.

3. Now I'll check the imports to see if any of them import the listed definitions:
   - None of the imports are importing 'regex' (they import subprocess, re, and some thefuck modules)

4. According to the restrictions:
   - Keep all imports (since none import the listed definitions)
   - Keep the 'regex' definition since it's in the definitions list
   - Remove all other definitions not in the list

5. The other definitions in the file are:
   - match()
   - _parse_operations()
   - _get_operations()
   - get_new_command()
   - enabled_by_default
   These should be removed as they're not in the definitions list.

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
import subprocess
import re
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support
from thefuck.utils import for_app, replace_command
from thefuck.specific.dnf import dnf_available


regex = re.compile(r'No such command: (.*)\.')
</file_content>

I'll analyze the file and the definitions to keep. Here's my step-by-step process:

1. First, I'll check all import statements in the file:
   - `import subprocess` - not in definitions list, but needed for _parse_operations
   - `import re` - not in definitions list, but needed for _parse_operations
   - `from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support` - not in definitions list
   - `from thefuck.utils import for_app, replace_command` - not in definitions list
   - `from thefuck.specific.dnf import dnf_available` - not in definitions list

2. The definitions list contains only `_parse_operations`, which is defined in the file.

3. According to the restrictions:
   - We keep all imports since they're used by the kept definition
   - We keep `_parse_operations` since it's in the definitions list
   - We remove all other definitions not in the list

4. The regex pattern and other functions (match, _get_operations, get_new_command) should be removed.

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
import subprocess
import re
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support
from thefuck.utils import for_app, replace_command
from thefuck.specific.dnf import dnf_available


def _parse_operations(help_text_lines):
    # The regex has to be a bytes-style regex since reading from a file
    # like stdin returns a bytes-style object and a string-style regex
    # wouldn't work.
    operation_regex = re.compile(b'^([a-z-]+) +', re.MULTILINE)
    return operation_regex.findall(help_text_lines)
</file_content>
