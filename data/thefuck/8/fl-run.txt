The failing test is `test_get_new_command` in `tests/rules/test_dnf_no_such_command.py`.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 The test expects the function `get_new_command` to return a list containing the corrected command `'dnf install vim'` when given an incorrect command `'dnf isntall vim'`. However, the function returns an empty list, causing the test to fail.

To localize the fault, we need to trace the execution:

1. **Test File**: The test is in `tests/rules/test_dnf_no_such_command.py`. The test imports `get_new_command` from `thefuck.rules.dnf_no_such_command`.
2. **Rule File**: The `get_new_command` function is defined in `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`.

Let's inspect the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py` to understand why it's returning an empty list.tool_get_file_imports:

The `get_new_command` function uses `regex.findall` to extract the misspelled command from the `command.output` and then calls `replace_command` with the misspelled command and operations from `_get_operations()`. 

The issue might be in:
1. The `regex.findall` call not matching the output correctly.
2. The `replace_command` function not working as expected.
3. The `_get_operations` function returning incorrect or empty data.

Let's inspect the `regex` pattern and the `_get_operations` function to see if they are the root cause.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

 `regex` pattern is `r'No such command: (.*)\.'`, which should match the output `'No such command: isntall. Please use /usr/bin/dnf --help...'` and extract `'isntall'`. However, the test output includes additional text after the period, which might not be handled correctly.

The `_get_operations` function calls `dnf --help` and parses the output to return a list of valid operations. If this function fails to parse the output correctly, it might return an empty list, causing `replace_command` to fail.

Let's inspect the `_parse_operations` function to see how it processes the output of `dnf --help`.

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `_parse_operations` function uses a regex to extract operations from the `dnf --help` output. The regex `b'^([a-z-]+) +'` matches lines starting with lowercase letters and hyphens, followed by spaces. If the `dnf --help` output format doesn't match this pattern, the function might return an empty list.

### Fault Localization:
1. **`regex` in `dnf_no_such_command.py`**: The pattern `r'No such command: (.*)\.'` might not fully match the output due to additional text after the period.
2. **`_parse_operations`**: If the `dnf --help` output format doesn't match the regex, it could return an empty list, causing `replace_command` to fail.

The most likely fault is in the `regex` pattern in `dnf_no_such_command.py`. It should be updated to handle the full error message format.

### Final Answer:
name: `regex` (pattern for extracting misspelled command)
file: `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`
explanation: The regex pattern `r'No such command: (.*)\.'` does not fully match the error message output, which includes additional text after the period. This causes `regex.findall` to fail, leading to an empty list being returned by `get_new_command`.
