agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
### Step 7: Analyze the `patterns` List
The `patterns` list includes the string `'permission denied'`, which matches the `stderr` value `'Permission denied'` in the failing test. This is why the `match` function returns `True` for the given command.

### Step 8: Conclusion
The fault lies in the `patterns` list in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py`. The test expects the `match` function to return `False` for the given command, but the presence of `'permission denied'` in the `patterns` list causes it to return `True`.

### Final Output
name: `patterns` list  
file: `thefuck/rules/sudo.py`  
explanation: The `patterns` list includes `'permission denied'`, which causes the `match` function to return `True` for a command with `stderr='Permission denied'`. The test expects `False` for this case, indicating that the pattern is overly broad or incorrect.
