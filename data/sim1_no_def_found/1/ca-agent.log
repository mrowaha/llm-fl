Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I look at the file content - it's a Python file named "myproject/foo.py" containing just an empty function definition for `bar()`

2. Next, I check the definitions list - it contains ['foo']

3. Now I apply the restrictions:
   - There are no import statements in the file to check
   - The definition 'foo' is not defined in the file (only 'bar' is defined)
   - Since 'foo' is not imported or defined in the file, we don't need to keep anything

4. Final decision: Since there are no relevant imports or definitions to keep, the file content should be empty.

<file_content>
</file_content>

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I look at the definitions we need to examine - only 'import' is listed
2. The file contains 3 import statements:
   - import pytest
   - from myproject.foo import bar
   - from myproject.bar import foo
3. Since 'import' is in our definitions list, we should keep all import statements
4. The test function and other code should be removed as they're not in our definitions list

Here's the shortened file content:

<file_content>
import pytest
from myproject.foo import bar
from myproject.bar import foo
</file_content>

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The file content contains a single function definition for `foo()`
2. The definitions list contains `['foo']`, meaning we need to keep anything related to 'foo'
3. Since 'foo' is defined directly in the file (not imported), we should keep it
4. There are no other definitions or imports to consider in this simple file

Final output will keep the entire file content since it only contains the definition we need to preserve.

<file_content>
 def foo():
 return "bar"
</file_content>
