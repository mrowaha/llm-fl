Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
To localize the fault, I will start by analyzing the failingOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 test output and the executed files. The failing test is `test_fmtonoff4` in `tests/test_black.py`, and the issue appears to be related to formatting differences between the expected and actual output. The test is comparing the formatting of Python code with `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.

### Steps to Localize the Fault:

1. **Understand the Test Case**:
   - The test is checking the formatting of a Python file with `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.
   - The expected output includes specific indentation and line breaks, while the actual output differs in these aspects.

2. **Trace the Execution**:
   - The test calls `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)`, which is defined in `tests/test_black.py`.
   - The actual output is generated by the Black formatter, which is likely implemented in `black.py`.

3. **Inspect the Test File**:
   - I will first look at the `test_fmtonoff4` method in `tests/test_black.py` to understand the test logic and the expected behavior.
   - Then, I will trace the execution to the Black formatter's logic in `black.py`.

4. **Analyze the Black Formatter**:
   - The issue likely lies in how Black handles the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives, particularly around indentation and line breaks.

### Next Steps:

1. Retrieve the `test_fmtonoff4` method from `tests/test_black.py` to understand the test case.
2. Retrieve the `assertFormatEqual` method from `tests/test_black.py` to understand how the comparison is made.
3. Retrieve the relevant parts of `black.py` that handle the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.

Let's start by fetching the `test_fmtonoff4` method from `tests/test_black.py`.

It seems there was a typo in the function name. The correct function name is likely `test_fmtonoff4` (as per the failing test output). Let me try again with the correct name.

The `test_fmtonoff4` function reads data from a file (likely `fmtonoff4.py` or similar) and compares the formatted output (`actual`) with the expected output. The key steps are:
1. `read_data("fmtonoff4")` reads the source and expected formatted output.
2. `fs(source)` formats the source code using the Black formatter.
3. `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)` compares the expected and actual formatted output.

The test fails because the actual formatted output does not match the expected output. The issue likely lies in the Black formatter's handling of `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.

### Next Steps:
1. Retrieve the `assertFormatEqual` method from `tests/test_black.py` to understand how the comparison is made.
2. Retrieve the relevant parts of `black.py` that handle the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.

Let's fetch the `assertFormatEqual` method first.

 `assertFormatEqual` method compares the `expected` and `actual` strings and prints debug information (parse trees) if they don't match. The actual comparison is done using `self.assertEqual(expected, actual)`. The debug output shows the parse trees for both the expected and actual formatted code, which helps identify discrepancies.

### Key Observations:
1. The test fails because the actual formatted output does not match the expected output.
2. The debug output shows differences in indentation and line breaks around the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.

### Next Steps:
1. The issue likely lies in the Black formatter's logic for handling `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives. We need to inspect the relevant parts of `black.py`.
2. Specifically, we should look for functions or methods in `black.py` that handle these directives and control formatting behavior.

The `tests/test_black.py` file imports `black` directly, so the Black formatter's logic is in `black.py`. The issue likely lies in how `black.py` handles the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.

### Next Steps:
1. We need to inspect the parts of `black.py` that handle these directives. Specifically, we should look for functions or methods that:
   - Parse the source code.
   - Handle formatting toggles (`# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on`).
   - Control indentation and line breaks.

2. Let's fetch the `lib2to3_parse` function from `black.py`, as it is used in the debug output of `assertFormatEqual`. This function might be involved in parsing the source code.

 `lib2to3_parse` function in `black.py` is responsible for parsing the source code into a lib2to3 parse tree. It ensures the source text ends with a newline and attempts to parse it using grammars compatible with the target Python versions. If parsing fails, it raises an `InvalidInput` exception.

However, this function does not directly handle the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives. The issue likely lies elsewhere in `black.py`, possibly in the logic that processes the parse tree and applies formatting.

### Next Steps:
1. We need to inspect the parts of `black.py` that handle formatting toggles (`# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on`). These directives are likely processed during the formatting phase, not the parsing phase.
2. Let's look for functions or methods in `black.py` that control formatting behavior, especially around these directives.

I will fetch the `format_str` function from `black.py`, as it is likely the entry point for formatting logic.

The `format_str` function in `black.py` is the core function that formats the source code. Here's how it works:
1. It parses the source code into a lib2to3 parse tree (`src_node`).
2. It processes the parse tree to generate formatted lines (`LineGenerator`).
3. It handles empty lines and splits lines to fit within the specified line length.

### Key Observations:
1. The function calls `normalize_fmt_off(src_node)`, which likely handles the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.
2. The issue might be in how `normalize_fmt_off` processes these directives or how the `LineGenerator` respects them.

### Next Steps:
1. Fetch the `normalize_fmt_off` function from `black.py` to inspect how it handles the directives.
2. Fetch the `LineGenerator` class or its `visit` method to understand how it processes the parse tree.

The `normalize_fmt_off` function in `black.py` processes `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives by converting the content between them into standalone comments. It does this by repeatedly calling `convert_one_fmt_off_pair(node)` until no more pairs are found.

### Next Steps:
1. Fetch the `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` function to understand how it identifies and processes the `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives.
2. This function is likely where the issue lies, as it controls how the formatter ignores or preserves formatting between these directives.

The `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` function in `black.py` is responsible for identifying and processing a single pair of `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives. Here's how it works:
1. It scans the parse tree for comments that match `FMT_OFF` (likely `# fmt: off`).
2. It checks if the comment is a standalone comment or part of a larger prefix.
3. It collects the nodes between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` (`ignored_nodes`) and converts them into a standalone comment to preserve their formatting.

### Key Observations:
1. The function ensures that the content between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` is preserved as-is by converting it into a standalone comment.
2. However, the failing test indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output in terms of indentation and line breaks. This suggests that the function might not be preserving the exact formatting (e.g., indentation) of the ignored nodes.

### Potential Issue:
The function might not be correctly preserving the indentation or line breaks of the ignored nodes when converting them into a standalone comment. Specifically:
- The `hidden_value` is constructed by concatenating the ignored nodes' string representations, but the original indentation might not be preserved.
- The `prefix` handling might not account for the original indentation of the ignored nodes.

### Next Steps:
1. Inspect the `generate_ignored_nodes` function to understand how it collects the nodes between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on`.
2. Verify how the `prefix` of the ignored nodes is handled when constructing the `hidden_value`.

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `generate_ignored_nodes` function in `black.py` collects nodes (leaves) between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` directives. Here's how it works:
1. It starts from the container of the given `leaf` (the node containing the `# fmt: off` comment).
2. It iterates through the container's siblings until it finds a `# fmt: on` comment or reaches the end of the block.
3. It yields each container node in this range.

### Key Observations:
1. The function correctly identifies the range of nodes to ignore (between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on`).
2. However, the issue might not be in this function but in how the `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` function processes the collected nodes (e.g., preserving indentation and line breaks).

### Root Cause:
The `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` function constructs a `hidden_value` by concatenating the string representations of the ignored nodes. However, it might not preserve the original indentation and line breaks because:
- The `prefix` of the ignored nodes is not fully incorporated into the `hidden_value`.
- The `hidden_value` is constructed by simply joining the string representations of the nodes, which might not account for their original formatting.

### Solution:
To fix the issue, the `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` function should:
1. Preserve the original indentation of the ignored nodes by including their `prefix` in the `hidden_value`.
2. Ensure that line breaks are preserved exactly as they appear in the source code.

### Final Answer:
The fault lies in the `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` function in `black.py`. It does not fully preserve the original indentation and line breaks of the nodes between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` when converting them into a standalone comment. The function should be modified to:
1. Include the original `prefix` of each ignored node in the `hidden_value`.
2. Ensure that line breaks are preserved exactly as in the source code. 

This will ensure that the formatted output matches the expected output in the test case.
