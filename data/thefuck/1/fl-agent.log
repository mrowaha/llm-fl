agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` uses the regex pattern `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` to extract the broken command from the error message. As identified earlier, this pattern fails to match commands that include non-alphabetic characters like `+`.

### Step 5: Propose a Fix
The regex pattern should be updated to include non-alphabetic characters (like `+`) in the broken command. For example, the pattern could be modified to:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

This updated pattern will match:
- Alphabetic characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`).
- The `+` character.

### Step 6: Validate the Fix
To ensure the fix works, the test case `test_get_new_command` should pass with the updated regex pattern. The test input `pip un+install thefuck` will now correctly match the broken command `un+install` from the error message.

### Conclusion
The fault is in the regex pattern in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The pattern needs to be updated to handle non-alphabetic characters in the broken command. The fix involves modifying the regex to include `+` and other possible non-alphabetic characters that might appear in pip commands.
