Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I look at the definitions we need to examine - which is just ['import statements'].

2. Looking at the file content:
   - It has two import statements: `import pytest` and `from myproject.bar import bar`

3. According to the restrictions:
   - We should keep all import statements that import any of the listed definitions
   - Since our definitions list only contains 'import statements', we should keep ALL import statements
   - We should remove all other definitions (like the test function)

4. The test function `test_get_foo` is not an import statement, so it should be removed.

Here's the shortened file content:

<file_content>
import pytest
from myproject.bar import bar
</file_content>

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I look at the file content - it has an import statement and a function definition
2. The definitions to examine only includes 'import statements'
3. According to the restrictions:
   - I must keep all import statements that import any listed definitions (but 'import statements' is a category, not a specific definition)
   - Since there are no specific definitions listed that are being imported, I need to check if the import statement should be kept
   - The import statement imports 'foo' from 'myproject.foo', but 'foo' is not in the definitions list
4. Since none of the imported items are in the definitions list, I should remove the import statement
5. The function 'bar' is defined in the script but not in the definitions list, so it should be removed

Final shortened file would be empty, but I'll wrap it in the required tags:

<file_content>
</file_content>
