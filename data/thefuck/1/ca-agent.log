I'll analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll check the imports - we need to keep all of them regardless of definitions
2. Then I'll look at the definitions to keep - we need to preserve 'get_new_command'
3. Other definitions (like 'match') should be removed
4. The file has some decorators above the match function, but since we're not keeping match, we can remove those too

The analysis shows:
<analysis>
- Kept 3 import statements
- Kept 'get_new_command' function as requested
- Removed 'match' function and its decorators
- Preserved the function body of get_new_command
</analysis>

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
import re
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument, for_app
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                            command.output)[0]
</file_content>
