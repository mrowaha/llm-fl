agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` uses the following regular expression to extract the broken command from the output:
```python
re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

### Identified Issue:
1. **Regular Expression Limitation**:
   - The pattern `[a-z]+` only matches lowercase letters, but the broken command in the test case (`un+install`) contains a `+` character. This causes the `re.findall` to return an empty list, leading to the `IndexError`.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function should handle commands with special characters (like `+`) in the broken command.

### Fix Suggestion:
The regular expression should be updated to include special characters that might appear in the broken command. For example:
```python
re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```
This will match both letters and the `+` character.

### Verification:
To confirm this is the issue, I will:
1. Check if the `match` function in the same file has any constraints on the command format (though it currently has a `pass` statement, so it's not restrictive).
2. Ensure no other parts of the code rely on the broken command being lowercase-only.

Since the `match` function is empty (`pass`), it does not impose any additional constraints, so the issue is isolated to the `get_new_command` function's regex.

### Final Diagnosis:
The fault lies in the `get_new_command` function's regular expression pattern, which does not account for special characters like `+` in the broken command. Updating the regex to include such characters should resolve the issue.
