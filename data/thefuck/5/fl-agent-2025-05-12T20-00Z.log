agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `match` function checks two conditions:
1. `'push' in command.script_parts`: Checks if the command script contains the word "push".
2. `'set-upstream' in command.output`: Checks if the output contains the word "set-upstream".

In the failing test, the output (`output_bitbucket`) contains the string `'set-upstream'`, and the command script is `'git push origin'`, which contains `'push'`. Therefore, the `match` function returns `True`.

### Issue:
The test expects `match` to return `False` for this output, but the function's logic is too broad. It matches any `git push` command with `'set-upstream'` in the output, even if the output is benign (like the Bitbucket pull request message in the test).

### Faulty Code Hunk:
name: `match` function  
file: `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`  
explanation: The `match` function's logic is too permissive. It incorrectly matches `git push` commands with `'set-upstream'` in the output, even when the output is not an error or requires correction. The function should be refined to only match cases where the `set-upstream` message indicates an actual issue (e.g., a missing upstream branch).
