Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
To localize the fault, I will start by analyzing the failingOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 test and then trace the execution to identify where the discrepancy occurs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Failing Test
The failing test is `TestFish.test_info` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py`. The test expects the output of `shell.info()` to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the `info()` method in the `Fish` shell class is not formatting the version string correctly.

### Step 2: Trace the Execution
The test is mocking `Popen` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` as the output of the shell command. The `info()` method is then called, and its output is compared to the expected string.

### Step 3: Locate the `info()` Method
The `Fish` shell class is likely defined in `thefuck/shells/fish.py`. I will retrieve the content of this file to inspect the `info()` method.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `info()` method in the `Fish` class retrieves the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and formats the output as `'Fish Shell {}'`. However, the test is mocking the output of `Popen` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which suggests that the actual output of the command is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Step 4: Identify the Discrepancy
The issue arises because the `info()` method assumes the output of the command is just the version number (e.g., `3.5.9`), but the actual output includes additional text (`'fish, version 3.5.9'`). The test expects the version string to be formatted as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the method is including the entire output (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).

### Step 5: Propose the Fix
The `info()` method should parse the output to extract only the version number (`3.5.9`) from the string `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. Here's how the method could be modified:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version number from the output
    version_number = version.split()[-1]  # Assumes the version is the last word
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

### Reasoning
- The current implementation does not account for the additional text in the output of the command.
- The fix involves parsing the output to extract only the version number, which aligns with the test's expectations.

Would you like me to proceed with verifying the fix or further analyzing the issue?
