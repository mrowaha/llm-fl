Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll check the imports:
   - `re` is a standard library import (not in definitions list)
   - `replace_argument` is imported but not in definitions list
   - `git_support` is imported but not in definitions list

2. Looking at the definitions:
   - `match` is in the definitions list and is defined in the file
   - `get_new_command` is in the definitions list and is defined in the file
   - `_get_upstream_option_index` is not in the definitions list

3. According to the restrictions:
   - Keep all imports that import any listed definitions (none do)
   - Keep definitions that are in the list (match and get_new_command)
   - Remove other definitions (_get_upstream_option_index)
   - Remove imports that don't import listed definitions

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support


@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)


@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument


    # In case of `git push -u` we don't have next argument:
    # the only non-qualified permitted options are the repository and refspec; git's
    # suggestion include them, so they won't be lost, but would be duplicated otherwise.
</file_content>
