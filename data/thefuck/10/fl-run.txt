Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
To localize the fault, we need to trace the execution starting from the failing test file `tests/rules/test_dnf_no_such_command.py`. The test is failing because the output of `_get_operations()` does not match the expected `dnf_operations`. Specifically, the issue is that the output contains byte strings (`b'autoremove'`) instead of regular strings (`'autoremove'`).

### Step 1: Analyze the failing test
The failing test is `test_get_operations` in `tests/rules/test_dnf_no_such_command.py`. The test asserts that the output of `_get_operations()` should equal `dnf_operations`. The mismatch is due to byte strings vs. regular strings.

### Step 2: Locate `_get_operations()`
The function `_get_operations()` is likely defined in one of the executed files. Given the test file's name (`test_dnf_no_such_command.py`), the corresponding rule implementation is likely in `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`.

### Step 3: Retrieve the content of `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`
We need to inspect the `_get_operations` function in this file.

-- Tool output:

> def _get_operations():
>     proc = subprocess.Popen(["dnf", '--help'],

>                             stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

- if the line begins with > then it was executed

The `_get_operations` function reads the output of the `dnf --help` command and passes it to `_parse_operations`. The issue is that `proc.stdout.read()` returns bytes, not strings, which explains why the output contains byte strings (`b'autoremove'`).

### Step 4: Locate `_parse_operations`
The `_parse_operations` function is called in `_get_operations` and is likely defined in the same file. We need to inspect its implementation to see if it handles byte strings correctly.
-- Tool called: get_function_body_tool, args: {"file_path":"thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py","function_name":"_parse_operations"}
-- Tool output:
<function_body_with_coverage file_path=thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py>
> def _parse_operations(help_text_lines):
      # The regex has to be a bytes-style regex since reading from a file
      # like stdin returns a bytes-style object and a string-style regex
      # wouldn't work.
>     operation_regex = re.compile(b'^([a-z-]+) +', re.MULTILINE)
>     return operation_regex.findall(help_text_lines)


<analysis>
- if the line begins with > then it was executed
- if the lines begins with ! then it was not executed
- if all the lines in the function begin with !, this funciton was never executed so ignore it
</analysis>

</function_body_with_coverage>

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `_parse_operations` function uses a bytes-style regex (`b'^([a-z-]+) +'`) to parse the input, which is correct because `help_text_lines` is a bytes object. However, the function returns the matched byte strings directly, which is the root cause of the issue in the test.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The fault lies in the `_parse_operations` function, which returns byte strings instead of decoding them to regular strings. The test expects regular strings (`'autoremove'`), but the function returns byte strings (`b'autoremove'`).

### Final Answer:
name: `_parse_operations`  
file: `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`  
explanation: The function returns byte strings instead of decoding them to regular strings, causing the test to fail due to a mismatch in string types. The function should decode the byte strings before returning them.
