The failing test is `test_match` in `tests/rules/test_no_command.py`,OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 and it is trying to mock the `which` function from `thefuck.rules.no_command`. However, the error indicates that the module `thefuck.rules.no_command` does not have the attribute `which`. This suggests that the test is trying to mock a function that does not exist in the module.

### Steps to Trace the Fault:
1. **Failing Test**: The test is trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but this function does not exist in the module.
2. **Module Inspection**: We need to inspect the `no_command.py` module to see what functions are defined there and whether `which` is supposed to be there or not.

### Next Steps:
1. Check the content of `thefuck/rules/no_command.py` to see what functions are defined.
2. Verify if `which` is supposed to be imported or defined in this module.tool_get_file_imports:
 from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables, get_valid_history_without_current, get_closest
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

-- Tool called: get_file_import_statements, args: {"file_path":"thefuck/rules/no_command.py"}
-- Tool output:
    <import_statements file_path="thefuck/rules/no_command.py">    
    from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables, get_valid_history_without_current, get_closest
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support
    </import_statements>

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `no_command.py` module imports `get_all_executables`, `get_valid_history_without_current`, and `get_closest` from `thefuck.utils`, but it does not import or define a `which` function. This confirms that the test is trying to mock a non-existent function.

### Fault Localization:
The fault lies in the test file `tests/rules/test_no_command.py`, where the test is attempting to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but this function does not exist in the module. The test is incorrectly assuming the presence of `which` in the `no_command` module.

### Output:
name: test_match  
file: tests/rules/test_no_command.py  
explanation: The test is trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but this function does not exist in the module. The test is incorrectly assuming the presence of `which` in the `no_command` module.
