### Step 6: Identify the Fault
The `foo()` function is returning `"foo-2"`, but the test expects `"foo"`. This is the root cause of the failing test. The discrepancy arises because the `foo()` function is hardcoded to return `"foo-2"` instead of `"foo"`.

### Conclusion
The fault lies in the `foo()` function in `myproject/x.py`. It should return `"foo"` to match the expected behavior in the test. The current implementation returns `"foo-2"`, causing the test to fail. 

### Suggested Fix
Modify the `foo()` function in `myproject/x.py` to return `"foo"` instead of `"foo-2"`. For example:
```python
def foo():
    return "foo"
```
