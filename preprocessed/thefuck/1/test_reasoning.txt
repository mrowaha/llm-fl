Alright, I need to figure out why this test is failing. Let's start by looking at what's happening.

The test `test_get_new_command` is using `pytest.mark.parametrize`, which means it runs multiple cases. The failure is in the first case where `script` is 'pip un+install thefuck'. The goal here is to assert that the command returned by `get_new_command` matches the expected `new_cmd`, which is 'pip uninstall thefuck'.

Looking at the code inside `get_new_command()`, there's this regex: `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]`. It seems like it's trying to extract the broken command from the error message. But wait, after 'un+install', the command might be in a split form or something? No, the regex should match the quoted string.

When the test runs for this case, `broken_cmd` is being accessed at index [0], but if the regex doesn't find anything, it'll throw an IndexError. Looking at the error message, "un+install" is correctly matched as the broken command. So that part works.

But then in the next lines, I see:

if broken_cmd:
    suggested_cmd = broken_cmd
elif 'install' in command.script_parts:
    suggested_cmd = 'install'
...

Wait, so if `broken_cmd` exists, it uses that. But in our test case, that should happen. So why does the test fail?

Looking at how the regex is written: `r'ERROR: unknown command "un+install"'`. The quote here is a double backslash in raw strings? No, wait, no—it's just one backslash because it's in the string as "un+install".

Wait, but in Python regex patterns, the backslashes need to be escaped. So if the error message actually has a single quote or something else? No, looking at the test input, `pip un+install thefuck` leads to an error with 'un+install' in quotes. So the pattern should match that.

Wait, perhaps the regex is expecting lowercase letters only since [a-z]+ excludes uppercase. The error message uses lowercase? Let me double-check: yes, "un+install" is all lowercase except for the plus. Wait, no—the "un+" would be lowercase letters and a '+', but the pattern expects [a-z] which includes letters only. So 'un+' won't be matched as broken_cmd becomes None because '+' isn't a letter.

Ah! That's probably the issue. The regex `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is only matching the part before any non-alphabetic characters, so it stops at the '+'. So `broken_cmd` would be 'un', not 'un+install', and thus an empty list or incorrect value.

So in the test case where script is 'pip un+install thefuck', the broken command would actually be extracted as 'un' because after that comes a '+', which isn't captured. Then, when the code proceeds to check if `broken_cmd` exists, it does—so `suggested_cmd = 'un'`. 

But according to the test setup in `pip_unknown_cmd.py`, for this specific test case, it expects `broken_cmd` to be 'un+install', which isn't happening. Therefore, when it tries to get `broken_cmd[0]`, it might actually be a list with only one element, but perhaps not matching the expected value.

Wait, no—let me re-examine. If the regex is finding 'un' because after that comes a '+', which is not matched by [a-z]+. So broken_cmd becomes ['un']. Then `[0]` is accessed, which is 'un'. But in the test case, it expects `get_new_command()` to return 'pip uninstall thefuck'. However, since broken_cmd is 'un' instead of 'un+install', the suggested command becomes 'un' instead of suggesting to use 'uninstall'.

This mismatch causes the assertion to fail because the function isn't returning the expected new command.

So, the core problem is that the regex in `get_new_command()` can only capture up to letters in the broken command. It needs to handle cases where commands might have special characters or other symbols. The current pattern fails when the broken command includes symbols like '+'.
</think>

The test is failing because the regular expression used to extract the broken command (`broken_cmd`) doesn't account for possible non-alphabetic characters, such as '+', in the command name. This causes `broken_cmd` to capture only part of the command before encountering a symbol, leading to an incorrect suggested fix.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Error:** The test fails due to an `IndexError` when accessing `[0]` on an empty list.
2. **Analyze Command Extraction:** The regex pattern in `get_new_command()` captures only sequences of lowercase letters, which fails for commands with symbols like '+'.
3. **Understand Broken Command Handling:** The broken command isn't correctly extracted, so the script incorrectly suggests a fix based on an incomplete command name.

**Answer:**

The failing test occurs because the regex used to extract the unknown command (`broken_cmd`) only matches lowercase letters and doesn't account for special characters or symbols in command names. When the input command is `pip un+install thefuck`, the regex captures "un" instead of "un+install," leading to incorrect processing and causing the test assertion to fail due to an unexpected suggested command.

The reason behind the failing test is that the regex pattern in `get_new_command()` doesn't correctly handle commands with special characters, resulting in incomplete extraction of the broken command.
