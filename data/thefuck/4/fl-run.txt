The failing test output indicates that the issue occurs in the `_get_aliases` function in `thefuck/shells/fish.py`. The error message shows that the function fails when trying to split an alias string into `name` and `value` because it expects 2 values but gets only 1. This happens because the alias string `'alias alias_with_equal_sign=echo'` contains an equals sign (`=`), which is not handled correctly by the current splitting logic.

### Analysis:
1. The function splits the alias string using `split(' ', 1)`, which assumes that the alias definition is separated by a space.
2. However, the alias string `'alias alias_with_equal_sign=echo'` uses an equals sign (`=`) to separate the name and value, which causes the split to fail.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
The issue lies in the line where the alias string is split:
```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```

This line does not account for aliases that use an equals sign (`=`) as a separator.

### Corrective Action:
The function should handle both space-separated and equals-sign-separated aliases. For example, it could first replace `=` with a space before splitting.

### Output:
name: `_get_aliases`  
file: `thefuck/shells/fish.py`  
explanation: The function fails to handle alias definitions that use an equals sign (`=`) as a separator, causing a `ValueError` when splitting the alias string. The splitting logic should account for both space-separated and equals-sign-separated aliases.
