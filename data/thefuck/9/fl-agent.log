### Final Analysis:

1. **Regex Issue**:
   - The regex `b'^([a-z-]+) +'` is designed to match lines in the output of `dnf --help` that start with lowercase letters and hyphens, followed by spaces.
   - However, the actual output of `dnf --help` might not match this pattern, causing `_parse_operations` to return an empty list.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The function assumes the output is in bytes (as indicated by the comment), but the regex might not account for variations in the output format (e.g., different spacing, uppercase letters, or other formatting).

### Solution:
- Adjust the regex in `_parse_operations` to better match the actual output of `dnf --help`. For example:
  - Include uppercase letters if commands can start with them.
  - Relax the spacing requirement if the output format varies.
  - Ensure the output is correctly decoded if necessary.

### Example Fix:
```python
operation_regex = re.compile(b'^([a-zA-Z-]+)\\s+', re.MULTILINE)
```

### Conclusion:
The fault lies in the regex pattern in `_parse_operations`, which fails to match the actual output of `dnf --help`. Adjusting the regex to better match the output will resolve the issue.
