agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `_get_aliases` function is responsible for parsing the output of the `fish` shell's `alias` command and returning a dictionary of aliases. Here's the breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Input**: The function takes a set of `overridden` aliases (aliases that should be ignored).
2. **Process**:
   - It runs the `fish -ic alias` command to get the list of aliases.
   - It splits the output into lines and processes each line.
   - For each line, it removes the `alias ` prefix and splits the remaining string into `name` and `value` using `split(' ', 1)`.
   - If the `name` is not in the `overridden` set, it adds the alias to the `aliases` dictionary.

### **Problem Identified**
The issue arises in the line:
```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```
This assumes that the alias line is in the format:
```
alias name value
```
However, the `fish` shell also supports aliases in the format:
```
alias name=value
```
When such a line is encountered (e.g., `alias alias_with_equal_sign=echo`), the `split(' ', 1)` operation fails because there is no space to split on.

### **Solution**
The function should handle both formats:
1. `alias name value`
2. `alias name=value`

We can modify the parsing logic to:
1. Remove the `alias ` prefix.
2. Split the remaining string into `name` and `value` by first checking for `=` and then falling back to splitting by space.

### **Next Steps**
To confirm the fix, I will:
1. Check if there are any other edge cases in the `alias` output (e.g., invalid lines like `'invalid_alias'` in the test output).
2. Propose a modified version of the `_get_aliases` function that handles both formats.

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with drafting the fix.
