OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The failing test is `test_bracket_match` in `tests/test_black.py`, and the error occurs in `black.py`. The error is a `KeyError` in the `mark` method of the `bracket_tracker` object, specifically when trying to pop a key `(0, 8)` from `bracket_match`.

To trace the execution:
1. The test calls `format_str` in `black.py`, which processes the source code.
2. The `visit` method in `black.py` traverses the AST nodes.
3. The `visit_default` method appends nodes to `current_line`, which triggers the `mark` method in `bracket_tracker`.
4. The `mark` method fails when it cannot find the key `(0, 8)` in `bracket_match`.

Next, I will inspect the `bracket_tracker` class and its `mark` method in `black.py`.

TheOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 issue lies in the `mark` method of the `BracketTracker` class in `black.py`. The error occurs when the method tries to pop a key `(0, 8)` from `bracket_match`, but the key does not exist. This suggests that the method is attempting to match a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket.

### Analysis:
1. The `mark` method processes leaves (tokens) and tracks bracket pairs.
2. When encountering a closing bracket (`leaf.type in CLOSING_BRACKETS`), it decrements the depth and attempts to pop the corresponding opening bracket from `bracket_match` using `(self.depth, leaf.type)` as the key.
3. The `KeyError` indicates that no such opening bracket was recorded for the closing bracket being processed.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
The `mark` method does not handle cases where a closing bracket is encountered without a corresponding opening bracket. This can happen if the input code is malformed or if the tracking logic misses an opening bracket.

### Fault:
The `mark` method should either:
- Skip processing the closing bracket if no matching opening bracket exists, or
- Raise a more descriptive error for malformed input.

### Output:
name: `mark` method in `BracketTracker` class 

file: `black.py`  
explanation: The method fails to handle cases where a closing bracket is encountered without a corresponding opening bracket, leading to a `KeyError`. The logic should either skip such cases or provide a meaningful error message.
