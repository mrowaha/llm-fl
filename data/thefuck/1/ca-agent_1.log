Okay, let's see. The user wants me to shorten the provided Python file by removing empty functions and classes. First, I need to go through each part of the code and check for any functions or class methods that don't have a body.
Looking at the code, there are several pytest fixtures defined. The first one is 'pip_unknown_cmd_without_recommend' and 'broken', 'suggested'ï¿½all of these are declared with the @pytest.fixture decorator but don't have any code inside. So those functions are empty. I should remove them.
Then there's the 'pip_unknown_cmd' fixture which uses 'broken' and 'suggested' as parameters. That seems okay because it has a return statement. But since the other fixtures are empty, they should be removed.
Next, the 'test_match' function is defined but doesn't have any code inside. So that's an empty function and should be removed. 
The 'test_get_new_command' function has a parametrize decorator and some code. But looking closer, the function body is just the assert statement. Wait, no, the code shows that the function has a body with the assert. So that's not empty. But wait, the user's example shows that functions with only comments or docstrings are removed. In this case, the 'test_match' function has no body, so it's empty. So I need to remove that.
Also, the 'test_get_new_command' function has a body with the assert, so it should stay. 
Now, checking for any classes. The code doesn't have any class definitions, so no need to worry about that. 
So the steps are: remove all the empty fixtures and the empty test function. The 'test_get_new_command' remains. The 'pip_unknown_cmd' fixture is okay because it has a return statement, even though the other fixtures it depends on are removed. Wait, but if the 'broken' and 'suggested' fixtures are removed, then 'pip_unknown_cmd' would have dependencies on them. But since those are removed, maybe that's an error. But according to the rules, I should only remove empty functions. The 'pip_unknown_cmd' function is not empty, so it's kept. 
So the final code should have the imports, the 'pip_unknown_cmd' fixture, and the 'test_get_new_command' function. The other fixtures and the 'test_match' function are removed because they are empty.

Okay, let's take a look at the provided Python file. The user wants me to shorten it by removing empty functions and classes as per the rules.
First, I'll scan through the code. The first part is the import section, which seems fine. Then there's a decorator with @sudo_support and @for_app applied to a function called match. The match function is defined but has an empty body. Wait, looking at the code, the match function's body is empty. The code inside the function is indented, but maybe it's a typo or incomplete. Wait, the code shows:

@sudo_support
@for_app('pip', 'pip2', 'pip3')
def match(command):
 
So the function is defined but has no body. That's an empty function. According to the rules, I should remove such functions. So the match function should be removed.
Next, there's another function called get_new_command. Let me check its body. The code shows:

def get_new_command(command):
     broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                             command.output)[0]
 
Wait, this function has a body. It's using re.findall and assigning the result to broken_cmd. So this function is not empty. Therefore, it should stay.
So the only empty function here is match. So I need to remove the match function. The get_new_command function remains. Also, there are no classes mentioned here, so no need to check for empty classes.
So the shortened code should have the imports, the get_new_command function, and remove the match function. Let me verify again. The original code had the match function with no body, so it's empty. The get_new_command has code. So the answer is to remove the match function.
