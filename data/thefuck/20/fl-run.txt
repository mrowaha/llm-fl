 `AttributeError` where the `Function` object has no attribute `get_marker`. This error occurs in the `functional` fixture defined in `tests/conftest.py` at line 44. The issue arises because the test is trying to use `get_marker`, which is deprecated or no longer available in the version of pytest being used.

### Steps to Localize the Fault:
1. **Identify the failing file**: The error occurs in `tests/conftest.py`, specifically in the `functional` fixture.
2. **Trace the execution**: The `functional` fixture is used in the test `test_match[git submodule update unknown-unknown]` located in `tests/rules/test_git_add.py`. However, the root cause is in the `functional` fixture.
3. **Analyze the fixture**: The fixture checks for a marker named `functional` using `request.node.get_marker`, which is causing the error.

### Fault Localization:
The issue is with the use of `get_marker` in the `functional` fixture. This method is deprecated in newer versions of pytest, and the correct way to check for markers is to use `request.node.get_closest_marker` or similar alternatives.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
name: `functional` fixture  
file: `tests/conftest.py`  
explanation: The fixture uses the deprecated `get_marker` method to check for the `functional` marker. This method is no longer available in the version of pytest being used, leading to the `AttributeError`. The fixture should be updated to use `get_closest_marker` or another modern alternative.

Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
To localize the fault, let'sOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 start by analyzing the failing test and the relevant files involved in the test execution.

### 1. Analyze the Failing Test
The failing test is `test_not_match` in `tests/rules/test_sudo.py`. The test asserts that:
1. `match(Command())` should return `False`.
2. `match(Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'))` should also return `False`.

The second assertion fails because `match` returns `True` when it should return `False`.

### 2. Trace the Execution
The `match` function is likely defined in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py` since the test is testing the `sudo` rule. Let's confirm this by checking the imports in `tests/rules/test_sudo.py`.

#### Check Imports in `tests/rules/test_sudo.py`
tool_get_file_imports:
 import pytest
from thefuck.rules.sudo import match, get_new_command
from tests.utils import Command

-- Tool called: get_file_import_statements, args: {"file_path":"tests/rules/test_sudo.py"}
-- Tool output:
    <import_statements file_path="tests/rules/test_sudo.py">       
    import pytest
from thefuck.rules.sudo import match, get_new_command
from tests.utils import Command
    </import_statements>

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `match` function is imported from `thefuck/rules/sudo.py`. Now, let's examine the `match` function in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py`.

#### Retrieve the `match` Function

-- Tool called: get_function_body_tool, args: {"file_path":"thefuck/rules/sudo.py","function_name":"match"}
-- Tool output:
<function_body_with_coverage file_path=thefuck/rules/sudo.py>      
> def match(command):
>     for pattern in patterns:
>         if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
>                 or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():    
>             return True
>     return False


<analysis>
- if the line begins with > then it was executed
- if the lines begins with ! then it was not executed
- if all the lines in the function begin with !, this funciton was never executed so ignore it
</analysis>

 `match` function checks if any pattern in the `patterns` list is found in the `command.stderr` or `command.stdout` (case-insensitive). If a pattern is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### 3. Analyze the Fault
The test expects `match(Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'))` to return `False`, but it returns `True`. This suggests that the `patterns` list in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py` includes a pattern that matches `'Permission denied'`.

Let's retrieve the `patterns` variable from `thefuck/rules/sudo.py` to confirm this.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

             'non-root users cannot',
             'Operation not permitted',
             'root privilege',

The `patterns` list includes `'permission denied'`, which matches the `stderr` value `'Permission denied'` in the failing test. This explains why `match` returns `True` for the command `sudo ls` with `stderr='Permission denied'`.

### 4. Conclusion
The `match` function is behaving as designed, but the test expects it to return `False` for this case. This suggests that the test is incorrect or the `patterns` list is too broad. However, since the `patterns` list is explicitly designed to catch `'permission denied'` errors, the fault lies in the test's expectation.

### Final Answer
name: `test_not_match`  
file: `tests/rules/test_sudo.py`  
explanation: The test expects `match` to return `False` for a command with `stderr='Permission denied'`, but the `patterns` list in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py` explicitly includes `'permission denied'`. The test's expectation is incorrect given the design of the `match` function.
