ize the fault, let's analyze the failing test and trace the execution step by step.

### 1. Analyze the Failing Test
The failing test is `test_get_new_command` in `tests/rules/test_git_push.py`. The test asserts that the function `get_new_command` should return `"git push --set-upstream origin master"` when given a `Command` object with the stderr output indicating that the current branch has no upstream branch.

The test fails when the input command is `'git push -u origin'`. The actual output is `'git push --set-upstream origin master -u origin'`, which incorrectly appends `-u origin` to the expected command.

### 2. Trace the Execution
The function `get_new_command` is likely defined in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` (since the test is for the `git_push` rule). Let's inspect this file to understand the logic.

#### Step 1: Get the import statements of the failing test file
First, we need to confirm the import statements in `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` to ensure the source of `get_new_command`.tool_get_file_imports:
 import pytest
from thefuck.rules.git_push import match, get_new_command
from tests.utils import Command

-- Tool called: get_file_import_statements, args: {"file_path":"tests/rules/test_git_push.py"}
-- Tool output: 
    <import_statements file_path="tests/rules/test_git_push.py">
    import pytest
from thefuck.rules.git_push import match, get_new_command
from tests.utils import Command
    </import_statements>

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The import statements confirm that `get_new_command` is imported from `thefuck.rules.git_push`. Let's inspect the `git_push.py` file to understand the implementation of `get_new_command`.

#### Step 2: Get the content of `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`
We need to analyze the `get_new_command` function in this file.
-- Tool called: get_function_body_tool, args: {"file_path":"thefuck/rules/git_push.py","function_name":"get_new_command"}
-- Tool output:
<function_body_with_coverage file_path=thefuck/rules/git_push.py>
> @git_support
> def get_new_command(command):
>     push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
>     return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)


<analysis>
- if the line begins with > then it was executed
- if the lines begins with ! then it was not executed
- if all the lines in the function begin with !, this funciton was never executed so ignore it

TheOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 `get_new_command` function is decorated with `@git_support` and takes a `command` object as input. It extracts the `push_upstream` command from the stderr output and replaces the `push` argument in the original command script with the extracted `push_upstream` command.

### 3. Identify the Fault
The fault lies in how the function handles the replacement of the `push` argument. The function does not account for cases where the original command already includes flags like `-u origin`. As a result, it appends the `push_upstream` command (`--set-upstream origin master`) to the original command (`git push -u origin`), leading to the incorrect output `git push --set-upstream origin master -u origin`.

### 4. Expected Behavior
The function should ensure that the `push_upstream` command replaces the entire `push` part of the original command, including any flags like `-u origin`.

### 5. Faulty Code Hunk
The faulty code hunk is the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`. The issue is that it does not strip or handle existing flags in the original command before replacing the `push` argument.

### Final Output
name: `get_new_command`
file: `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`  
explanation: The function appends the `push_upstream` command to the original command without stripping existing flags (like `-u origin`), leading to incorrect output. It should replace the entire `push` part of the command, including flags, with the `push_upstream` command.
