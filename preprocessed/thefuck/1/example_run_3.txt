It seems like the `get_new_command` function is trying to extract the broken command and a suggested replacement from the output provided by the `command`. However, there are a couple of issues here:

1. The regular expression for extracting the broken command might not be capturing the intended result due to potential variations or spaces in the error message.
2. The use of `[0]` to access an element at index 0 assumes that the list returned by `re.findall` is always non-empty, which is not guaranteed.

To address these issues, we could modify the regular expression and add some error handling:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    # Adjust the regex pattern to account for potential spaces or variations in the output format
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"(.+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"(.+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1).lower()  # Normalize to lowercase
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)  # Keep original case for suggestion

        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unable to parse the command and new command from error message.")
```

This version of `get_new_command` uses regular expressions with capturing groups and handles cases where matches are not found by raising a `ValueError`. This should provide more robust parsing and avoid potential runtime errors.
