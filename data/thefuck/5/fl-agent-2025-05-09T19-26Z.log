agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `match` function in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` checks two conditions:
1. The command script contains the word `'push'`.
2. The command output contains the phrase `'set-upstream'`.

In the failing test, the `Command` object has:
- `script='git push origin'` (contains `'push'`).
- `output` contains `'set-upstream'`.

Thus, the `match` function returns `True`, which is why the assertion `assert not match(...)` fails.

### 3. Identify the Issue
The test expects `match` to return `False` for this specific output, but the current implementation returns `True`. This suggests that the `match` function's logic is too permissive. It should not match this specific Bitbucket output where a pull request is being suggested.

### 4. Proposed Fix
The `match` function should be refined to exclude cases where the output is suggesting a pull request (as in Bitbucket). For example, it could check for the absence of phrases like `'Create pull request'` in the output.

### 5. Verify the Fix
To confirm, let's check if the `output_bitbucket` in the test contains `'Create pull request'`: 
```python
output_bitbucket = 'Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote:\nremote: Create pull request for feature/set-upstream:\nremote:   http...-> feature/set-upstream\nBranch feature/set-upstream set up to track remote branch feature/set-upstream from origin.\n'
```
Yes, it does. Therefore, the `match` function should be updated to exclude such cases.

### 6. Update the `match` Function
The updated `match` function could look like this:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output
            and 'Create pull request' not in command.output)
```

### 7. Conclusion
The fault lies in the `match` function in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`. It incorrectly matches Bitbucket's output suggesting a pull request. The fix involves adding an additional condition to exclude such outputs.
