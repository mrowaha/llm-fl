agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `functional` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` is using the deprecated `get_marker` method, which is causing the `AttributeError`. The correct method to use in newer versions of pytest is `get_closest_marker` or `iter_markers`.

### Fault Localization:
- **Faulty Code Hunk**: The use of `request.node.get_marker('functional')` in the `functional` fixture.
- **File Path**: `tests/conftest.py`
- **Explanation**: The `get_marker` method is deprecated in pytest, and the test fails because the `Function` object no longer has this attribute. The fixture should be updated to use `get_closest_marker` or `iter_markers` instead.

### Output:
name: `functional` fixture  
file: `tests/conftest.py`  
explanation: The fixture uses the deprecated `get_marker` method, which is no longer available in newer versions of pytest, causing the `AttributeError`. The method should be replaced with `get_closest_marker` or `iter_markers`.
