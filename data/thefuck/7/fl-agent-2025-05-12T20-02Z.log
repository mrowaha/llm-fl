agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `match` function in `thefuck/rules/php_s.py` checks if the string `"php -s"` is present in the `command.script`. However, the failing test case provides a `Command` object with the script `'php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080'`. 

### Step 4: Identify the Issue
The `match` function is only checking for the substring `"php -s"`, but the test case includes `-t pub` before `-s`. This means the function fails to match the script because it doesn't account for additional flags or arguments before `-s`.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The `match` function is too restrictive in its matching logic. It should be updated to handle cases where there are other flags or arguments before `-s` in the PHP command.

### Faulty Code Hunk
name: `match`  
file: `thefuck/rules/php_s.py`  
explanation: The `match` function fails to account for additional flags or arguments before `-s` in the PHP command, causing it to return `False` for valid cases like `php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080`. The function should be updated to handle such variations.
