 failing test is `test_get_new_command` in `tests/rules/test_pip_unknown_command.py`, which tests the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The test expects the function to correct the command `pip un+install thefuck` to `pip uninstall thefuck` based on the error message `ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"`.

The error occurs because `re.findall` in `get_new_command` is not matching the expected pattern in the error message, resulting in an empty list and an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element.

### Steps to Trace the Execution:
1. **Failing Test**: The test expects `get_new_command` to return `pip uninstall thefuck` for the input `pip un+install thefuck`.
2. **Error Message**: The error message is `ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"`.
3. **Function `get_new_command`**: It tries to extract the broken command (`un+install`) from the error message using `re.findall`.

### Analysis:
The issue lies in the regular expression pattern in `get_new_command`. The current pattern `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` does not account for the `+` character in the command (`un+install`). The `+` is not included in the character class `[a-z]`, so the pattern fails to match the command.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
The faulty code hunk is the regular expression pattern in the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`.

### Output:
```output
name: get_new_command
file: thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py
explanation: The regular expression pattern in `get_new_command` does not account for the `+` character in the command, causing the pattern to fail to match the error message and resulting in an `IndexError`.
