The failing test is `test_match_bitbucket` in `tests/rules/test_git_push.py`. The test asserts that the `match` function should return `False` for a specific `git push` command output, but it is returning `True` instead. Let's trace the execution:

1. **Failing Test File**: `tests/rules/test_git_push.py`
   - The test calls `match(Command('git push origin', output_bitbucket))` and expects `False`, but gets `True`.

2. **Imports in `test_git_push.py`**:
   - To locate the `match` function, we need to check the imports in `test_git_push.py`.tool_get_file_imports:
 import pytest
from thefuck.rules.git_push import match, get_new_command
from thefuck.types import Command

-- Tool called: get_file_import_statements, args: {"file_path":"tests/rules/test_git_push.py"}
-- Tool output:
    <import_statements file_path="tests/rules/test_git_push.py">
    import pytest
from thefuck.rules.git_push import match, get_new_command
from thefuck.types import Command
    </import_statements>

The `match` function is imported from `theOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
fuck.rules.git_push`. Let's examine the `match` function in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` to understand why it returns `True` for the given output.

The `match` function checks two conditions:
1. `'push' in command.script_parts`: Checks if the command script contains the word "push".
2. `'set-upstream' in command.output`: Checks if the output contains the word "set-upstream".

In the failing test, the output (`output_bitbucket`) contains the string `'set-upstream'`, and the command script is `'git push origin'`, which contains `'push'`. Therefore, the `match` function returns `True`.

### Issue:
The test expects `match` to return `False` for this output, but the function's logic is too broad. It matches any `git push` command with `'set-upstream'` in the output, even if the output is benign (like the Bitbucket pull request message in the test).

### Faulty Code Hunk:
name: `match` function  
file: `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`  
explanation: The `match` function's logic is too permissive. It incorrectly matches `git push` commands with `'set-upstream'` in the output, even when the output is not an error or requires correction. The function should be refined to only match cases where the `set-upstream` message indicates an actual issue (e.g., a missing upstream branch).
