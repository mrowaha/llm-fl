agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/man.py` is generating multiple command suggestions, including `'man 3 missing'` and `'man 2 missing'`, along with `'missing --help'`. The test expects only `['missing --help']` as output when the manual entry is missing (`No manual entry for missing`).

### Fault Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function checks if `'3'` or `'2'` is in the command script, but this is irrelevant for the test case where the manual entry is missing.
   - It then constructs `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` by inserting `' 2 '` and `' 3 '` into the command parts.
   - Finally, it returns a list with three items: `last_arg + ' --help'`, `"".join(split_cmd3)`, and `"".join(split_cmd2)`.

2. **Issue**:
   - The function does not account for the case where the manual entry is missing (as indicated by the stderr `No manual entry for missing`).
   - It unconditionally returns all three suggestions, even when the manual entry is missing.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
The `get_new_command` function is faulty because it does not filter out the `man`-related suggestions when the manual entry is missing.

### Output:
```output
name: get_new_command
file: thefuck/rules/man.py
explanation: The function unconditionally returns all command suggestions (including 'man 3' and 'man 2' variants) even when the manual entry is missing. It should only return 'missing --help' in such cases.
```
