The failing test output indicates anOPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
 `AttributeError` where the `Function` object has no attribute `get_marker`. This error occurs in the `functional` fixture defined in `tests/conftest.py` at line 44. The issue arises because the test is trying to use `get_marker`, which is deprecated or no longer available in the version of pytest being used.

### Steps to Localize the Fault:
1. **Identify the failing file**: The error occurs in `tests/conftest.py`, specifically in the `functional` fixture.
2. **Trace the execution**: The `functional` fixture is used in the test `test_match[git submodule update unknown-unknown]` located in `tests/rules/test_git_add.py`. However, the root cause is in the `functional` fixture.
3. **Analyze the fixture**: The fixture checks for a marker named `functional` using `request.node.get_marker`, which is causing the error.

### Fault Localization:
The issue is with the use of `get_marker` in the `functional` fixture. This method is deprecated in newer versions of pytest, and the correct way to check for markers is to use `request.node.get_closest_marker` or similar alternatives.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
name: `functional` fixture  
file: `tests/conftest.py`  
explanation: The fixture uses the deprecated `get_marker` method to check for the `functional` marker. This method is no longer available in the version of pytest being used, leading to the `AttributeError`. The fixture should be updated to use `get_closest_marker` or another modern alternative.
