1. First, I will keep all import statements as required.
2. Next, I will look for the definition 'get_new_command' in the file and keep it.
3. I will remove all other definitions (functions, variables, etc.) that are not in the definitions_to_examine list.
4. The regex variable is used by get_new_command, so I need to keep it as well since it's a dependency.
5. The enabled_by_default variable is not in the list, so it will be removed.
6. The match function and helper functions (_parse_operations, _get_operations) will be removed as they're not in the list.

3. After finding it, I will keep it and remove all other definitions (functions, variables etc.) that are not in the requested definitions list.
4. The regex variable is not in the requested definitions list, so it will be removed.

The task is to shorten the given Python file by keeping only:
1. All import statements
2. The requested definition '_parse_operations'
3. Removing all other definitions

The file contains 5 import statements at the top. The definition '_parse_operations' is a function that appears in the middle of the file. We need to keep this function while removing all other function definitions (match, _get_operations, get_new_command) and variables (regex, enabled_by_default).
