Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to shorten the provided Python file by removing empty functions and classes as per the rules. First, I need to understand what constitutes an empty function here. The rules say to remove functions with no body, just pass, or only comments/docstrings. Same for class methods if they're empty.

Looking at the code, I'll start by scanning each function and class. Let's go line by line.

The first part of the file has imports and some setup. Then there's the `memoize` function. Wait, the `memoize` function has a body, so it's not empty. The `memoize.disabled` line is part of the function's scope, so that's okay.

Next, there's the `@memoize` decorator for the `which` function. But the `which` function's body is empty. The docstring is present, but the function has no code. So according to the rules, I should remove this function.

Then there's `default_settings` which has a docstring and some code. So it's not empty. Similarly, `get_closest` and `get_close_matches` have code, so they stay.

Looking at `get_all_executables`, it has a body, so it's kept. `replace_argument` also has code. The `eager` decorator and the `get_all_matched_commands` function have code, so they stay.

The `replace_command` function has a docstring and code, so it's kept. `is_app` and `for_app` also have code. The `Cache` class has multiple methods, but some might be empty. Wait, looking at `Cache`:

- `__init__` has code (initializing _db to None), so it's okay.
- `_init_db` has code, so keep.
- `_setup_db` has code, but the comment about Python versions might be a note, but the function has code, so keep.
- `_get_cache_dir` has code, so keep.
- `_get_mtime` has code, keep.
- `_get_key` has code, keep.
- `get_value` has code, keep.

So the `Cache` class isn't empty. Then `_cache = Cache()` is fine.

The `cache` function has a decorator and a wrapper, so it's not empty. The `get_installation_info` function is empty? Wait, looking at the code, the function is defined but has no body. Wait, in the original code, the `get_installation_info` function is defined but its body is empty? Let me check the original code again.

In the provided code, after `cache.disabled = False`, there's a `def get_installation_info():` but the body is empty. So that's an empty function. So it should be removed.

Similarly, `get_alias` has a return statement, so it's not empty. The `get_valid_history_without_current` function has a docstring and code, so it's kept.

The `format_raw_script` function has a docstring and code, so it's kept.

So, the functions to remove are:

- `which` (empty body)
- `get_installation_info` (empty body)
- `get_valid_history_without_current`? Wait, no, the original code shows that function has a docstring and code, so it's kept.

Wait, looking at the original code again. Wait, in the code provided, after the `get_all_executables` function, there's a `def replace_argument(...)` with code, then `@decorator def eager(...)` which is a decorator, then `@eager def get_all_matched_commands(...)` which has code. Then `replace_command` has code. Then `@memoize def is_app(...)` which has code. Then `for_app` has code. Then the `Cache` class with methods. Then `_cache = Cache()`.

Then `cache` function with code. Then `get_installation_info()` which is defined but has no body. Then `get_alias` which has code. Then `@memoize def get_valid_history_without_current(...)` which has code? Wait, looking at the code:

In the original code, the `get_valid_history_without_current` function is defined with a docstring but the body is empty? Let me check the code again.

Wait, the code shows:

def get_valid_history_without_current(command):
    """Helper for *_no_command rules."""
    pass

Wait, no. Wait, in the given code, after `is_app` and `for_app`, there's:

def get_valid_history_without_current(command):
    """Helper for *_no_command rules."""
    pass

Wait, no, the original code might have that function. Wait in the provided code, after the `is_app` function, there's:

def get_valid_history_without_current(command):
    """Helper for *_no_command rules."""
    pass

But in the code the user provided, the actual code might be different. Let me recheck the code.

Looking at the code as given:

The user's code has:

    def get_valid_history_without_current(command):
        """Helper for *_no_command rules."""
   


Wait, the function is defined but has no body except the docstring. So that's an empty function. So it should be removed.

Similarly, the `which` function is empty. And the `get_installation_info` function is empty.

So, the functions to remove are:

- `which` (empty body)
- `get_installation_info` (empty body)
- `get_valid_history_without_current` (empty body, only docstring)

Other functions like `default_settings`, `get_closest`, `get_close_matches`, `get_all_executables`, `replace_argument`, `eager`, `get_all_matched_commands`, `replace_command`, `is_app`, `for_app`, `cache`, `get_alias`, `format_raw_script` have bodies, so they stay.

The `Cache` class has methods that are not empty, so it's kept.

So, the final code will have all the functions except those three empty ones. Let me make sure.

So, the answer should be the original code minus those three functions.
