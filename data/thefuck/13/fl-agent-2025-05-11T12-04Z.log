agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `get_new_command` function is decorated with `@git_support` and takes a `command` object as input. It extracts the `push_upstream` command from the stderr output and replaces the `push` argument in the original command script with the extracted `push_upstream` command.

### 3. Identify the Fault
The fault lies in how the function handles the replacement of the `push` argument. The function does not account for cases where the original command already includes flags like `-u origin`. As a result, it appends the `push_upstream` command (`--set-upstream origin master`) to the original command (`git push -u origin`), leading to the incorrect output `git push --set-upstream origin master -u origin`.

### 4. Expected Behavior
The function should ensure that the `push_upstream` command replaces the entire `push` part of the original command, including any flags like `-u origin`.

### 5. Faulty Code Hunk
The faulty code hunk is the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`. The issue is that it does not strip or handle existing flags in the original command before replacing the `push` argument.

### Final Output
name: `get_new_command`  
file: `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`  
explanation: The function appends the `push_upstream` command to the original command without stripping existing flags (like `-u origin`), leading to incorrect output. It should replace the entire `push` part of the command, including flags, with the `push_upstream` command.
