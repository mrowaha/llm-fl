Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
The failing test output indicates an `AttributeError` where the `OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
Function` object has no attribute `get_marker`. This error occurs in the `functional` fixture defined in `tests/conftest.py`. The issue arises because the test is trying to use `get_marker`, which is deprecated in newer versions of `pytest`.

### Steps to Localize the Fault:
1. **Identify the failing test**: The error occurs in `tests/rules/test_git_branch_exists.py` during the setup of `test_get_new_command[git checkout bar-bar]`.
2. **Trace the execution**: The test uses a fixture `functional` defined in `tests/conftest.py`.
3. **Analyze the fixture**: The `functional` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` is using `request.node.get_marker`, which is deprecated.

### Fault Localization:
The fault lies in the `functional` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` where it uses the deprecated `get_marker` method. In newer versions of `pytest`, `get_marker` is replaced with `get_closest_marker`.

### Output:
name: `functional` fixture  
file: `tests/conftest.py`  
explanation: The fixture uses the deprecated `get_marker` method, which is no longer available in newer versions of `pytest`. It should be replaced with `get_closest_marker`.
