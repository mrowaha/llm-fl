Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I examine the file content - it contains an incomplete function definition `bar()` and no import statements.

2. Looking at the definitions to keep - only `['foo']` is requested.

3. Since there are no import statements, I don't need to preserve any.

4. The only definition in the file is `bar()` which is not in the keep list.

5. The requested definition `foo` is not present in the file.

6. Following the restrictions:
   - No imports to keep
   - No matching definitions to keep
   - All other content should be removed

Therefore, the output will be an empty file with just the wrapper tags.

<file_content>
</file_content>
