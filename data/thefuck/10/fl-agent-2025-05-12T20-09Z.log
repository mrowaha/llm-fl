agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `_parse_operations` function uses a bytes-style regex (`b'^([a-z-]+) +'`) to parse the input, which is correct because `help_text_lines` is a bytes object. However, the function returns the matched byte strings directly, which is the root cause of the issue in the test.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The fault lies in the `_parse_operations` function, which returns byte strings instead of decoding them to regular strings. The test expects regular strings (`'autoremove'`), but the function returns byte strings (`b'autoremove'`).

### Final Answer:
name: `_parse_operations`  
file: `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`  
explanation: The function returns byte strings instead of decoding them to regular strings, causing the test to fail due to a mismatch in string types. The function should decode the byte strings before returning them.
