agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The failing test is `test_get_new_command` in `tests/rules/test_git_branch_exists.py`, and it is failing because the function `get_new_command` in `thefuck/rules/git_branch_exists.py` raises an `IndexError` when trying to extract the branch name from the command output. The error occurs because the regex pattern does not match the output, resulting in an empty list, and the code attempts to access the first element of this empty list.

### Steps to Trace the Execution:
1. **Failing Test**: The test is checking the behavior of `get_new_command` when the output is `"fatal: A branch named 'let's-push-this' already exists."`. The expected output is a list of commands to handle the branch conflict.
2. **Function Under Test**: The function `get_new_command` is decorated with `@git_support` and `@eager`, and it is defined in `thefuck/rules/git_branch_exists.py`.
3. **Error Location**: The error occurs when the regex `r"fatal: A branch named '([^']*)' already exists."` fails to match the output, leading to an empty list and an `IndexError`.

### Analysis:
- The regex pattern in `get_new_command` is designed to extract the branch name from the output string `"fatal: A branch named 'branch-name' already exists."`.
- However, the test output includes a branch name with an apostrophe (`'let's-push-this'`), which might not be correctly handled by the regex pattern.
- The regex `r"fatal: A branch named '([^']*)' already exists."` uses `[^']*` to match any characters except an apostrophe, but the branch name itself contains an apostrophe, causing the regex to fail.

### Conclusion:
The fault lies in the regex pattern in the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/git_branch_exists.py`. The pattern does not account for branch names that contain apostrophes, leading to a failed match and an `IndexError`.

### Output:
```output
name: get_new_command
file: thefuck/rules/git_branch_exists.py
explanation: The regex pattern in the function fails to handle branch names containing apostrophes, causing an IndexError when the output does not match the pattern.
```
