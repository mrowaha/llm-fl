I'll analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll identify all import statements - these must be kept regardless of definitions:
   - import subprocess
   - import re
   - from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support
   - from thefuck.utils import for_app, replace_command
   - from thefuck.specific.dnf import dnf_available

2. The definitions we need to keep are:
   - 'get_new_command' (from the definitions_to_examine list)

3. Other definitions in the file that we'll remove:
   - regex
   - match
   - _parse_operations
   - _get_operations
   - enabled_by_default

4. The analysis shows we need to keep:
   - All imports
   - The get_new_command function
   - Any dependencies of get_new_command (which includes the regex variable since it's used in get_new_command)

<analysis>
- Keeping regex even though not explicitly requested because it's required by get_new_command
- Removing all other functions/variables not in the definitions list
- Preserving all import statements as required
</analysis>

I'll analyze this step by step:

1. First, I need to keep all import statements as per the restrictions:
   - import subprocess
   - import re
   - from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support
   - from thefuck.utils import for_app, replace_command
   - from thefuck.specific.dnf import dnf_available

2. The definitions to keep are ['_get_operations'], so I'll preserve that function.

3. All other definitions (regex, match, _parse_operations, get_new_command, enabled_by_default) should be removed.

4. The regex compilation line should be removed since it's not an import and not in the definitions to keep.

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
import subprocess
import re
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support
from thefuck.utils import for_app, replace_command
from thefuck.specific.dnf import dnf_available

def _get_operations():
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["dnf", '--help'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    lines = proc.stdout.read()

    return _parse_operations(lines)
</file_content>

<analysis>
1. Kept all 5 import statements as required
2. Preserved only the requested '_get_operations' function
3. Removed all other functions and variables not in the definitions list
4. Note that '_get_operations' calls '_parse_operations' which was removed - this would make the code non-functional, but we're strictly following the shortening rules
5. The file is now significantly shorter while meeting all requirements

<analysis>
1. The file contains imports: subprocess, re, and several from thefuck modules - these must be kept
2. The definitions to keep is only '_parse_operations'
3. All other definitions (regex, match, _get_operations, get_new_command, enabled_by_default) should be removed
4. The imports and requested definition must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original

1. First I will scan the file to identify all import statements which must be preserved
2. Then I will locate the 'replace_command' function which is in the definitions list and must be preserved
3. All other code that is not an import statement or the 'replace_command' function will be removed
4. The imports include: os, pickle, re, shelve, six, contextlib.closing, decorator.decorator, difflib.get_close_matches, functools.wraps, .logs.warn, .conf.settings, .system.Path
5. The 'replace_command' function appears to be a helper function for command replacement rules
