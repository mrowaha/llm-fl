agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `patterns` list includes `'permission denied'`, which matches the `stderr` value `'Permission denied'` in the failing test. This explains why `match` returns `True` for the command `sudo ls` with `stderr='Permission denied'`.

### 4. Conclusion
The `match` function is behaving as designed, but the test expects it to return `False` for this case. This suggests that the test is incorrect or the `patterns` list is too broad. However, since the `patterns` list is explicitly designed to catch `'permission denied'` errors, the fault lies in the test's expectation.

### Final Answer
name: `test_not_match`  
file: `tests/rules/test_sudo.py`  
explanation: The test expects `match` to return `False` for a command with `stderr='Permission denied'`, but the `patterns` list in `thefuck/rules/sudo.py` explicitly includes `'permission denied'`. The test's expectation is incorrect given the design of the `match` function.
