agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `bracket_tracker` class is actually named `BracketTracker` in `black.py`. The `mark` method is part of this class and is responsible for tracking brackets and delimiters in the code. The error occurs when the method tries to pop a key `(0, 8)` from `bracket_match`, but this key does not exist.

### Fault Analysis:
1. **KeyError**: The `mark` method assumes that `(self.depth, leaf.type)` exists in `bracket_match` when processing a closing bracket. However, in this case, the key `(0, 8)` is missing, indicating a mismatch in bracket tracking.
2. **Possible Causes**:
   - The `bracket_match` dictionary is not being populated correctly for certain types of brackets.
   - The `leaf.type` value `8` (which corresponds to a specific token type) is not being handled properly in the `mark` method.

### Faulty Code Hunk:
The `mark` method in the `BracketTracker` class is faulty because it does not handle cases where the `bracket_match` dictionary might not contain the expected key for a closing bracket.

### Output:
```output
name: mark
file: black.py
explanation: The method assumes the existence of a key in `bracket_match` when processing closing brackets, but fails to handle cases where the key is missing, leading to a KeyError. The method should include a check or default behavior for missing keys.
```
