agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `regex` pattern is designed to match the output string `No such command: <command>.`. However, the test output includes additional text after the command (`Please use /usr/bin/dnf --help...`), which might not be matched by this pattern. This could explain why the regex fails to extract the misspelled command, leading to an empty list being returned.

The fault lies in the `regex` pattern, which is too restrictive and does not account for the full output format of the `dnf` command. The pattern should be updated to handle the additional text in the output.

### Fault Localization:
name: `regex`  
file: `thefuck/rules/dnf_no_such_command.py`  
explanation: The regex pattern `No such command: (.*)\.` is too restrictive and fails to match the full output of the `dnf` command, which includes additional text after the command. This causes the `get_new_command` function to return an empty list instead of the corrected command.
