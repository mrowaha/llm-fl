I'll analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll look at the file content and identify:
   - 2 import statements (must keep both)
   - 1 function definition (bar) which is in the definitions list

2. Since 'bar' is in the definitions list, I'll keep it
3. I won't remove any other definitions since there are none to remove
4. No analysis tags were provided in the tool calls

Final output will maintain both imports and the 'bar' function.

<file_content>
from myproject.x import foo
from myproject.foo import x


def bar():
    x()
    return foo()
</file_content>

<analysis>
1. The file contains one definition: function 'x'
2. The definitions to keep list contains 'x' which matches the function
3. No imports are present in the file
4. No other definitions need to be removed since there's only one definition

<file_content>
def x():
    return 'x'

<analysis>
1. The file contains one definition: a function called 'foo'
2. The definitions_to_examine list contains 'foo', which matches the function in the file
3. There are no import statements to preserve
4. We will keep the 'foo' function and remove nothing else (since there's nothing else to remove)

    return 'foo-2'
