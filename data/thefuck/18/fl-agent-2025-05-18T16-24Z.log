agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The failing test output indicates an `AttributeError` where the `Function` object has no attribute `get_marker`. This error occurs in the `functional` fixture defined in `tests/conftest.py`. The issue arises because the test is trying to use `get_marker`, which is deprecated in newer versions of pytest.

### Steps to Trace the Fault:
1. **Identify the failing test**: The test is `TestFish.test_get_overridden_aliases[cut,git,sed]` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py`.
2. **Trace the setup**: The error occurs during the setup phase, specifically in the `functional` fixture in `tests/conftest.py`.
3. **Analyze the fixture**: The fixture uses `request.node.get_marker`, which is deprecated. The correct method in newer pytest versions is `request.node.get_closest_marker`.

### Fault Localization:
The fault lies in the `functional` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` where the deprecated `get_marker` method is used. This needs to be updated to `get_closest_marker`.

### Output:
name: functional  
file: tests/conftest.py  
explanation: The fixture uses the deprecated `get_marker` method, which is no longer available in newer pytest versions. It should be replaced with `get_closest_marker`.
