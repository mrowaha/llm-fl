The function `script_parts` from module `thefuck.types` has the following coverage based on the provided '>' and '!':

```python
>     @property
>     def script_parts(self):
!         if not hasattr(self, '_script_parts'):
!             try:
!                 self._script_parts = shell.split_command(self.script)  
!             except Exception:
!                 logs.debug(u"Can't split command script {} because:\n {}".format(
!                     self, sys.exc_info()))
!                 self._script_parts = []

!         return self._script_parts
```

Since all lines in the function were starting with '!', it means the function was not executed.
