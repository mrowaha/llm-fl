To localize the fault, let's analyze the failing test and the traceback step by step.

### 1. **Failing Test Analysis**
The failing test is `test_get_new_command` in `tests/rules/test_pip_unknown_command.py`. The test is parameterized with:
- `script = 'pip un+install thefuck'`
- `new_cmd = 'pip uninstall thefuck'`
- `pip_unknown_cmd = 'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'`

The test asserts that `get_new_command(Command(script, pip_unknown_cmd))` should return `new_cmd`. However, the test fails with an `IndexError` in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` at line 15.

### 2. **Traceback Analysis**
The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`. The specific line causing the error is:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```
The `IndexError` suggests that `re.findall` did not find any matches, so accessing index `[0]` fails.

### 3. **Root Cause Hypothesis**
The regular expression `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is not matching the `command.output` string:
```
'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'
```
The issue might be:
- The regex does not account for the `+` character in the command (`un+install`).
- The regex only matches lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`), but the command includes a `+`.

### 4. **Verification**
Let's fetch the `get_new_command` function from `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` to confirm the regex and logic.-- Tool was called: get_function_body_tool
-- Tool arguments: {"file_path":"thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py","function_name":"get_new_command"}
-- Tool output: 
<function_body_with_coverage>
> def get_new_command(command):
>     broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
>                             command.output)[0]
!     new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
  
!     return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)


<analysis>
- if the line begins with > then it was executed
- if the lines begins with ! then it was not executed
- if all the lines in the function begin with !, this funciton was never executed so ignore it
</analysis>

</function_body_with_coverage>

The `get_new_command` function shows that the regex `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is indeed the issue. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Executed Lines**:
   - The first line (`broken_cmd = re.findall(...)[0]`) was executed but failed with an `IndexError` because the regex did not match the `command.output`.

2. **Non-Executed Lines**:
   - The second line (`new_cmd = re.findall(...)[0]`) was not executed because the first line failed.
   - The return statement was also not executed.

### **Fault Confirmation**
The regex `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is too restrictive:
- It only matches lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`), but the actual command (`un+install`) contains a `+` character.
- The regex should account for special characters like `+` or be more flexible to match the actual command format.

### **Solution**
The regex should be updated to include `+` or other possible characters in the command. For example:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

This will match commands like `un+install` while still being strict enough to avoid false positives.

### **Next Steps**
To confirm the fix, we would:
1. Modify the regex in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`.
2. Re-run the test to verify it passes.
