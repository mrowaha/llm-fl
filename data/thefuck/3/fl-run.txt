The failing test is `TestFish.test_info` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py`. The test expects the `info()` method of the `Fish` shell class to return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but it is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This indicates that the `info()` method is not correctly parsing the version string from the output of the `fish` command.

### Steps to Localize the Fault:

1. **Identify the `info()` method in the `Fish` class**:
   The failing test is testing the `info()` method of the `Fish` shell class. The `Fish` class is likely defined in `thefuck/shells/fish.py`.

2. **Analyze the `info()` method**:
   The `info()` method is responsible for fetching and formatting the version information of the Fish shell. The test mock provides the output `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the method is not correctly stripping or formatting this string.

3. **Check the `info()` method implementation**:
   The method should extract the version number (`3.5.9`) from the output and format it as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Fault Localization:

The fault lies in the `info()` method of the `Fish` class in `thefuck/shells/fish.py`. The method is not correctly parsing the version string from the output of the `fish --version` command.

### Output:

name: `info`  
file: `thefuck/shells/fish.py`  
explanation: The `info` method in the `Fish` class is not correctly parsing the version string from the `fish --version` command output. It includes the raw output (`fish, version 3.5.9`) instead of extracting and formatting just the version number (`3.5.9`).
