[agent] ended with output:
The `get_new_command` function shows that the regex `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is indeed the issue. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Executed Lines**:
   - The first line (`broken_cmd = re.findall(...)[0]`) was executed but failed with an `IndexError` because the regex did not match the `command.output`.

2. **Non-Executed Lines**:
   - The second line (`new_cmd = re.findall(...)[0]`) was not executed because the first line failed.
   - The return statement was also not executed.

### **Fault Confirmation**
The regex `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is too restrictive:
- It only matches lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`), but the actual command (`un+install`) contains a `+` character.
- The regex should account for special characters like `+` or be more flexible to match the actual command format.

### **Solution**
The regex should be updated to include `+` or other possible characters in the command. For example:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

This will match commands like `un+install` while still being strict enough to avoid false positives.

### **Next Steps**
To confirm the fix, we would:
1. Modify the regex in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py`.
2. Re-run the test to verify it passes. 

Would you like me to proceed with fetching any additional details or implementing the fix?
