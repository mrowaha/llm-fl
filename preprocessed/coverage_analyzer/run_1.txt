Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to shorten the provided Python file content based on specific rules. The rules are to remove empty functions and empty class methods. If all methods of a class are removed, the class should also be removed.

First, I'll look at the content provided. The file seems to have several functions, but many of them are empty or have only comments or docstrings. Let me go through each function one by one.

Starting with `_get_socket_path()`: The function is defined but has no body. The line is empty after the def. So this is an empty function and should be removed.

Next, `is_available()` has a docstring but no actual code. The function is empty, so it should be removed as well.

Then there's `_get_last_n(n)`, which again has no code. It's an empty function.

`_get_output_lines(output)` is another empty function with nothing but the def.

Finally, `get_output(script)` has a docstring but no code. So this is also an empty function.

Looking at the code, there are no classes mentioned, so the second rule about removing classes with all empty methods doesn't apply here. All the functions are standalone, and each one is empty. Therefore, all of them should be removed.

The only lines that remain would be the import statements and the try-except block. However, the user's example shows that even if a function has a docstring but no code, it's removed. So in the output, none of the functions should be present. The final content should just have the imports and the try block, but since the functions are all empty, they are all stripped out.

So the shortened file will have the imports and the try block, but no functions. That's the result after applying the rules.
