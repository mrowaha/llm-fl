agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `_parse_operations` function uses a bytes-style regex (`b'^([a-z-]+) +'`) to parse the output, which confirms that the input (`help_text_lines`) is expected to be in bytes format. However, the test expects the output to be a list of strings, not bytes.

### 3. Fault Localization
The fault lies in the mismatch between the expected output (strings) and the actual output (bytes) from `_get_operations()`. The function `_parse_operations` correctly processes bytes, but the test expects strings. To fix this, we need to decode the bytes returned by `_get_operations()` into strings before comparing them in the test.

### 4. Suggested Fix
The test should decode the byte strings returned by `_get_operations()` into regular strings before performing the assertion. Alternatively, the `_get_operations` function could be modified to return strings instead of bytes.

### 5. Next Steps
Would you like me to propose a fix for the test or the `_get_operations` function?
