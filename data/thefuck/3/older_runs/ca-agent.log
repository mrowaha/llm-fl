Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll check which definitions are present in the file:
   - The main class is `Fish` which is in the definitions list we need to keep
   - There are also some helper functions like `_get_functions` and `_get_aliases`

2. Looking at imports:
   - All imports are standard or from parent packages except `six` which isn't used in the kept portions
   - The imports used by the Fish class are: Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL, cache

3. Based on the restrictions:
   - We must keep the `Fish` class definition
   - We can remove all other function definitions since they're not in our list
   - We should keep imports that are used by the kept definitions

4. Final cleanup:
   - Remove unused imports (six)
   - Keep Fish class and its methods
   - Remove cached functions since they're not in our definitions list

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
from .generic import Generic


class Fish(Generic):
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        pass

    def app_alias(self, alias_name):
        pass

    def get_aliases(self):
        pass

    def _expand_aliases(self, command_script):
        pass

    def _get_history_file_name(self):
        pass

    def _get_history_line(self, command_script):
        pass

    def _script_from_history(self, line):

        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

        pass

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll check which definitions from the list are present in the file:
   - The file contains a class `Bash` which is in our definitions list

2. Now I'll check what imports are used by this class:
   - The `Bash` class inherits from `Generic` which is imported from `.generic`
   - It uses `@memoize` decorator from `..utils`
   - It also imports several other modules (os, subprocess, tempfile, uuid) but these are standard Python libraries

3. According to the restrictions:
   - We must keep all imports that are used by our definitions (Bash)
   - We must keep the Bash class definition itself
   - We can remove other unused definitions

4. The imports we need to keep are:
   - from .generic import Generic
   - from ..utils import memoize
   - (standard library imports can stay as they might be used by Bash)

5. The final file should contain:
   - All imports
   - The Bash class definition
   - We can remove empty method implementations since they don't contain any code

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
import os
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from tempfile import gettempdir
from uuid import uuid4
from ..conf import settings
from ..const import ARGUMENT_PLACEHOLDER, USER_COMMAND_MARK
from ..utils import DEVNULL, memoize
from .generic import Generic


class Bash(Generic):
    pass

I'll analyze the file and definitions step by step:

1. First, I check if any of the definitions in the list ['Generic'] are imported from external modules:
   - 'Generic' is defined within the file itself (as a class), not imported.

2. Looking at the imports:
   - None of the imports are for the 'Generic' class, so we should keep all imports since they might be used by the Generic class.

3. Since 'Generic' is defined in the file, we should keep its entire definition.

4. The restrictions say to:
   - Keep all imports (since none import 'Generic')
   - Keep the 'Generic' class definition (since it's defined in the file)
   - Remove all other definitions (but there are no other top-level definitions to remove)
