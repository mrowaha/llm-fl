agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `_get_aliases` function is indeed the source of the fault. Here's the problematic part:
```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```
This line assumes that all aliases are formatted as `alias name value`. However, the test case includes an alias with an equals sign (`alias alias_with_equal_sign=echo`), which breaks the parsing logic.

### **Root Cause**
The function does not account for aliases that use `=` for assignment (e.g., `alias alias_with_equal_sign=echo`). The current implementation only splits on spaces, which fails for such cases.

### **Solution**
The function should handle both formats:
1. `alias name value` (space-separated)
2. `alias name=value` (equals-separated)

### **Next Steps**
To fix this, we need to modify the `_get_aliases` function to:
1. Replace `=` with a space before splitting, or
2. Split on either `=` or space, depending on the alias format.

Would you like me to propose a fix for this issue?
