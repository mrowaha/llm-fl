I'll analyze the file and shorten it according to the given restrictions.

Analysis:
1. The file contains 3 class definitions: Command, Rule, CorrectedCommand
2. We need to keep only the 'Command' class from the definitions list
3. We must preserve all import statements
4. We must remove Rule and CorrectedCommand classes since they're not in the definitions list

<file_content>
from thefuck import types
from thefuck.conf import DEFAULT_PRIORITY


class Command(types.Command):
    def __init__(self, script='', stdout='', stderr=''):
        super(Command, self).__init__(script, stdout, stderr)

I'll analyze this step by step:

1. First, I check the file content and see it contains:
   - A list variable `patterns`
   - A function `match`
   - An incomplete function `get_new_command`

2. According to the definitions to examine, we only need to keep the `match` function.

3. Following the restrictions:
   - There are no import statements to keep
   - We must keep the `match` function
   - We must remove all other definitions (the `patterns` list and `get_new_command` function)

4. The analysis shows we're keeping just the core matching function while removing supporting variables and other functions.

Here's the shortened file:

<file_content>
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
</file_content>

<analysis>
The shortened file maintains the core 'match' function as requested, while removing the patterns list and incomplete get_new_command function. Note that the function will now fail if run independently since it references the removed 'patterns' variable, but we're strictly following the instruction to only keep the 'match' definition.

I'll analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll check the file content and identify all definitions:
   - `patterns` (variable)
   - `match` (function)
   - `get_new_command` (function)

2. According to the definitions_to_examine, we only need to keep:
   - `patterns` (variable)
   - All import statements (though there are none in this file)

3. I'll remove all other definitions not in the list (match and get_new_command functions)

4. Since there are no import statements to preserve, I'll just keep the patterns variable definition.

Here's the shortened file content:

<file_content>
patterns = ['permission denied',
             'EACCES',
             'pkg: Insufficient privileges',
             'you cannot perform this operation unless you are root',
             'non-root users cannot',
             'Operation not permitted',
             'root privilege',
             'This command has to be run under the root user.',
             'This operation requires root.',
             'requested operation requires superuser privilege',
             'must be run as root',
             'must run as root',
             'must be superuser',
             'must be root',
             'need to be root',
             'need root',
