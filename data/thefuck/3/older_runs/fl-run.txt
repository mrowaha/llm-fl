The failing test is `TestFish.test_info` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py`. The test asserts that the `info()` method of the `Fish` shell class should return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but it is currently returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This indicates that the `info()` method is not correctly parsing the version string from the output of the `fish --version` command.

### Steps to Localize the Fault:
1. **Examine the Test**:
   - The test mocks the `Popen` object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` as the output of the `fish --version` command.
   - The `info()` method is expected to parse this output and return a clean version string (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`).

2. **Locate the `Fish` Class**:
   - The `Fish` class is likely defined in `thefuck/shells/fish.py` (based on the import structure and the test context).

3. **Inspect the `info()` Method**:
   - The `info()` method in the `Fish` class is responsible for parsing the version string and returning the formatted output.

4. **Compare with Other Shell Implementations**:
   - Other shell classes (e.g., `Bash`, `Zsh`) might have similar `info()` methods, which could provide hints on the correct parsing logic.

### Next Steps:
I will first locate the `Fish` class in `thefuck/shells/fish.py` and inspect its `info()` method to understand how it processes the version string.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

The `Fish` class is defined in `thefuck/shells/fish.py`, and its `info()` method is responsible for returning the shell name and version. The current implementation fetches the version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and formats it as `'Fish Shell {}'`. 

### Observations:
1. **Incorrect Command**:
   - The test expects the version to be parsed from the output of `fish --version` (which returns `'fish, version 3.5.9'`), but the `info()` method is using `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This discrepancy explains why the output includes the unwanted prefix `'fish, version '`.

2. **Comparison with Other Shells**:
   - Other shell implementations (e.g., `Bash`, `Zsh`) likely use `--version` to fetch the version string and then parse it to extract the version number. The `Fish` class should follow the same pattern.

### Next Steps:
I will inspect the `info()` method of another shell class (e.g., `Bash` or `Zsh`) to confirm the expected behavior and then update the `Fish` class accordingly.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

The `Bash` class in `thefuck/shells/bash.py` does not include the `info()` method, so it might inherit it from the `Generic` class. Let's inspect the `Generic` class in `thefuck/shells/generic.py` to see if the `info()` method is defined there.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `Generic` class in `thefuck/shells/generic.py` includes a placeholder for the `info()` method, but it does not provide an implementation. This suggests that the `info()` method is expected to be overridden by specific shell classes (like `Fish`).

### Current State:
- The `Fish` class's `info()` method uses `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to fetch the version, but the test expects it to parse the output of `fish --version` (which returns `'fish, version 3.5.9'`).
- The `info()` method in `Fish` should be updated to:
  1. Use `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
  2. Parse the version string (e.g., extract `3.5.9` from `'fish, version 3.5.9'`).

### Solution:
Update the `info()` method in the `Fish` class to:
1. Fetch the version using `fish --version`.
2. Parse the output to extract the version number (e.g., using string manipulation or regex).

Hereâ€™s the corrected implementation:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split('version ')[-1]  # Extracts '3.5.9' from 'fish, version 3.5.9'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Verification:
The test expects `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, and the updated implementation will now correctly return this by parsing the output of `fish --version`. 

Would you like me to proceed with this change or inspect any other files for further confirmation?
