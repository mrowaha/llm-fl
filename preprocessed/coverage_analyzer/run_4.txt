The failing test output indicates that the test `test_get_new_command` is failing because of an `IndexError` in the `get_new_command` function. The error occurs when trying to access the first element of the result of `re.findall`, which suggests that the regular expression did not match anything in the `command.output`.

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Test Context**:
   - The test is checking if the `get_new_command` function correctly transforms a command like `pip un+install thefuck` into `pip uninstall thefuck` when the output indicates an unknown command (`un+install`).
   - The `command.output` is: `'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'`.

2. **Failure Cause**:
   - The `get_new_command` function uses `re.findall` to extract the unknown command from the output. The regex is: `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'`.
   - The `IndexError` suggests that `re.findall` returned an empty list, meaning the regex did not match the output.

3. **Possible Issues**:
   - The regex pattern might not account for the `+` character in the command (`un+install`).
   - The output format might not match the expected regex pattern.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Inspect the `get_new_command` function to confirm the regex pattern and its logic.
   - Verify if the `command.output` format aligns with the regex expectations.

### Action Plan:
I will first fetch the content of the file containing the `get_new_command` function (the file name is masked, but it is likely imported in `tests/rules/test_pip_unknown_command.py`). Then, I will analyze the function's implementation.

Okay, let's see. I need to shorten this Python file by removing empty functions and classes. The user provided the file content, and I need to check for any functions that have no body or only comments/docstrings.

First, looking at the imports and the fixtures. There's a pytest fixture called pip_unknown_cmd_without_recommend, but it's defined with empty parentheses. So the function is declared but has no content. That's an empty function, so I should remove it.

Similarly, there's another fixture called broken, suggested, and pip_unknown_cmd. Wait, the broken and suggested fixtures are defined but have no code. Let me check again. The user's input shows:

@pytest.fixture
def pip_unknown_cmd_without_recommend():


That's an empty function. Same with broken and suggested. So those three fixtures are empty and should be removed.

Then, the test_match function is defined but has no body. The line 'def test_match(...):' is there but no code inside. So that's another empty function to remove.

The test_get_new_command function seems to have parametrized tests, so it's not empty. So I should keep that.

So, the steps are: remove all the empty functions. Let me check again:

- pip_unknown_cmd_without_recommend: empty, remove.
- broken: empty, remove.
- suggested: empty, remove.
- test_match: empty, remove.

The remaining code would be the imports, the test_get_new_command function, and the fixtures that are not empty. Wait, the pip_unknown_cmd fixture is defined with parameters and returns a string, so it's not empty. So that's kept.

So the final shortened code would have the imports, the pip_unknown_cmd fixture, and the test_get_new_command function. The other fixtures and the test_match function are removed because they are empty.

The test file `tests/rules/test_pip_unknown_command.py` imports the `get_new_command` function from `thefuck.rules.pip_unknown_command`. To analyze the issue, I need to fetch the content of the module `thefuck.rules.pip_unknown_command` to inspect the implementation of `get_new_command`.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to shorten this Python file based on the rules provided. The user wants me to remove empty functions and empty class methods. If all methods in a class are removed, then the class should also be removed.

Looking at the provided code, the first thing I notice is that there's an import section. Then there are two decorators, @sudo_support and @for_app, applied to a function called match. But wait, the function match has no body. The code inside the match function is empty. Let me check again. The code starts with @sudo_support and @for_app, then defines match(command): but there's nothing inside the function. So that's an empty function. According to rule 1, I should remove it.

Next, there's another function called get_new_command. Let me check its body. The code inside get_new_command has a line that uses re.findall and assigns the result to broken_cmd. So there is code here, so this function is not empty. Therefore, I should keep it.

Wait, but looking at the code again, the match function's body is empty. So I need to remove that. The get_new_command function has code, so it stays. Also, there's no class defined here, so no need to check for empty classes.

So the final shortened code should remove the empty match function and keep get_new_command. Let me make sure there are no other empty functions. The code seems to have only these two functions. So the answer should be the imports, the get_new_command function, and the decorators applied to match, but since match is empty, it's removed. Wait, the decorators are part of the function definition. So the line @sudo_support and @for_app are part of the function's decorators. So when removing the function, those decorators would also be removed. So the final code would have the imports, then the get_new_command function, and the match function is removed entirely.

So the output should have the imports, then the get_new_command function. Let me check again. The original code has:

import re
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument, for_app
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

@sudo_support
@for_app('pip', 'pip2', 'pip3')
def match(command):
    pass  # Wait, no, the original code here has no body. So the function is empty.

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                            command.output)[0]

Wait, in the original code, the match function is defined with no body. So it's an empty function. So I need to remove it. Therefore, the shortened code would have the imports, then the get_new_command function. The decorators on match are part of the function definition, so when the function is removed, those decorators are also gone.

So the final code would be:

import re
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument, for_app
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                            command.output)[0]

But wait, the original code has the match function with no body. So the code after the imports is:

@sudo_support
@for_app('pip', 'pip2', 'pip3')
def match(command):
    pass  # Wait, no, in the original code, the match function has no body. So the code is:

@sudo_support
@for_app('pip', 'pip2', 'pip3')
def match(command):
    # nothing here

So that's an empty function. So I remove it. The get_new_command function has code, so it's kept. Therefore, the final code is the imports plus the get_new_command function.

The `get_new_command` function in `thefuck/rules/pip_unknown_command.py` is using the following regex pattern to extract the unknown command from the output:

```python
r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'
```

### Issue Identified:
1. **Regex Limitation**:
   - The regex `([a-z]+)` only matches lowercase alphabetic characters (`a-z`). It does not account for the `+` character in the command `un+install`.
   - As a result, `re.findall` fails to match the command `un+install` and returns an empty list, causing the `IndexError`.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function should handle commands with special characters like `+` in them, as seen in the test case (`un+install`).

### Solution:
The regex pattern should be updated to include the `+` character (and possibly other special characters that might appear in pip commands). For example:

```python
r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z+]+)\"'
```

This change will allow the regex to match commands containing `+`.

### Verification:
To confirm, I can test the updated regex against the output `'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'`:

```python
import re
output = 'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'
re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z+]+)\"', output)
```

This should return `['un+install']`, resolving the `IndexError`.

The fault lies in the regex pattern in the `get_new_command` function. It needs to be updated to include the `+` character to correctly match commands like `un+install`.[run] agent Fault Localizer Agent has ended
