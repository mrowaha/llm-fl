agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
### Step 5: Identify the Fault
The `foo()` function in `myproject/x.py` returns `"foo-2"`, which explains why the output of `bar()` is `"foo-2"`. However, the test expects `bar()` to return `"foo"`. This discrepancy indicates that the `foo()` function is not behaving as expected.

### Conclusion
The fault lies in the `foo()` function, which returns an incorrect value (`"foo-2"` instead of `"foo"`). The test expects `"foo"`, but the function is hardcoded to return `"foo-2"`.

### Output
name: foo  
file: myproject/x.py  
explanation: The `foo()` function returns `"foo-2"`, but the test expects it to return `"foo"`. The function's hardcoded return value is incorrect.
