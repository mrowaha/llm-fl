Agent updated: Fault Localizer Agent
OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
To localize the fault, let's analyze the failing test and the executed files step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Failing Test
The failing test is `test_function_trailing_comma` in `tests/test_black.py`. The test expects a specific format for a function definition with a type annotation. The issue arises with the trailing comma in the type annotation, which changes the type and causes the test to fail.

### Step 2: Analyze the Expected vs. Actual Output
- **Expected Output**: The function definition should not have a trailing comma in the type annotation. The type annotation is wrapped in parentheses and formatted with newlines.
- **Actual Output**: The parser fails to parse the function definition, and the formatting does not match the expected output. The trailing comma seems to be causing the issue.

### Step 3: Trace the Execution
1. The test calls `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)`, which compares the formatted output of the function definition.
2. The formatting logic is likely handled in `black.py`, which is the main file for the Black formatter.

### Step 4: Locate the Relevant Code in `black.py`
We need to find the part of `black.py` that handles function definitions and type annotations. Specifically, we need to look for:
- The logic that formats function definitions.
- The logic that handles type annotations and trailing commas.

### Step 5: Retrieve Import Statements from `tests/test_black.py`
To confirm the relationship between the test and the main `black.py` file, let's check the import statements in `tests/test_black.py`.tool_get_file_imports:

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The test file `tests/test_black.py` imports `black` directly, confirming that the main logic for formatting is in `black.py`. Now, we need to inspect the relevant parts of `black.py` that handle function definitions and type annotations.

### Step 6: Retrieve the Relevant Code from `black.py`
We need to find the function or class in `black.py` responsible for formatting function definitions and type annotations. Given the failing test involves parsing and formatting, we should look for:
1. The main formatting logic.
2. The logic for handling type annotations.

Let's first check the file content of `black.py` for relevant definitions like `format_str`, `format_file_contents`, or any class that handles parsing and formatting.OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `format_str` function in `black.py` is responsible for formatting the input string (`src_contents`). It uses `lib2to3_parse` to parse the input and then processes it using `LineGenerator` and other utilities. The issue with the trailing comma in the type annotation likely stems from how `split_line` or `LineGenerator` handles such cases.       

### Step 7: Focus on `split_line` and `LineGenerator`
The `split_line` function is called with `split_line_features`, which includes `Feature.TRAILING_COMMA_IN_DEF`. This feature might be relevant to the issue. Let's inspect the `split_line` function and its dependencies.

The `split_line` function is responsible for splitting a line into multiple lines if it exceeds the `line_length`. The function handles different cases, including function definitions (`line.is_def`). The issue might be related to how `left_hand_split` or `right_hand_split` handles type annotations with trailing commas.

The `left_hand_split` function splits a line into three parts: `head`, `body`, and `tail`, based on the first matching bracket pair. The function raises `CannotSplit` if no brackets are found, which is not the case here since the function definition includes parentheses.

### Step 9: Inspect `bracket_split_build_line`

OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export
The `bracket_split_build_line` function handles the construction of lines, including adding trailing commas for imports (`original.is_import`). However, the issue in the failing test involves a type annotation (`->`) in a function definition, not an import. The function does not explicitly handle type annotations, which might be the root cause of the issue.

### Step 10: Conclusion
The fault lies in how `bracket_split_build_line` handles type annotations in function definitions. Specifically:
1. The function does not account for type annotations (`->`) when deciding whether to add or remove trailing commas.
2. The test expects the type annotation to be formatted without a trailing comma, but the current logic might be treating it like an import or other bracketed expression.

### Suggested Fix
Modify `bracket_split_build_line` to explicitly handle type annotations in function definitions, ensuring that trailing commas are not added to type annotations. This would involve:
1. Detecting if the line is part of a type annotation (`->`).
2. Skipping the trailing comma logic for such cases.

Would you like me to propose a specific code change for this?
