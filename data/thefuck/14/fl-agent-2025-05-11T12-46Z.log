agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `no_command.py` file imports `get_all_executables`, `get_valid_history_without_current`, and `get_closest` from `thefuck.utils`, but it does not import or define a `which` function. This explains why the test fails when trying to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`.

### Step 4: Verify the Test's Intention
The test is likely trying to mock a `which` function that is used within the `no_command` rule. However, since `which` is not part of the `no_command` module, the mock target is incorrect.

### Step 5: Identify the Correct Mock Target
The `which` function is likely imported from another module (e.g., `thefuck.utils` or a system utility). The test should mock the correct target where `which` is defined or used.

### Step 6: Conclusion
The fault lies in the test's assumption that `which` is part of the `no_command` module. The test should instead mock the `which` function from its actual source (e.g., `thefuck.utils.which` or a system utility like `shutil.which`).

### Fault Localization
The faulty code hunk is the test's mock target (`thefuck.rules.no_command.which`), which does not exist.

name: `test_not_match`'s mock target (`thefuck.rules.no_command.which`)
file: `tests/rules/test_no_command.py`
explanation: The test attempts to mock `thefuck.rules.no_command.which`, but the `no_command` module does not define or import a `which` function. The mock target is incorrect.
