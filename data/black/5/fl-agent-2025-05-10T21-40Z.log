agent=Fault Localizer Agent ended with output:
The `bracket_split_build_line` function handles the construction of lines, including adding trailing commas for imports (`original.is_import`). However, the issue in the failing test involves a type annotation (`->`) in a function definition, not an import. The function does not explicitly handle type annotations, which might be the root cause of the issue.

### Step 10: Conclusion
The fault lies in how `bracket_split_build_line` handles type annotations in function definitions. Specifically:
1. The function does not account for type annotations (`->`) when deciding whether to add or remove trailing commas.
2. The test expects the type annotation to be formatted without a trailing comma, but the current logic might be treating it like an import or other bracketed expression.

### Suggested Fix
Modify `bracket_split_build_line` to explicitly handle type annotations in function definitions, ensuring that trailing commas are not added to type annotations. This would involve:
1. Detecting if the line is part of a type annotation (`->`).
2. Skipping the trailing comma logic for such cases.

Would you like me to propose a specific code change for this?
